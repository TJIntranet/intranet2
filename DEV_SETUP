New Machine Setup Notes
=======================

Dependencies:
   * Apache
   * PHP (see notes below)
   * Heimdal kerberos
   * latex, dvips, latex2rtf, pdflatex
   * zip, unzip
   * cifs / smb

PHP Compilation:
   Iodine requires a number of standard PHP functions that are included
   with most standard Linux distributions. However, in Debian, SASL
   for LDAP is not built by default. Thus, it is necessary to custom
   build PHP for Debian.

   Steps to build Iodine's PHP for Debian:
   1. apt-get source php5     # get the sources
   2. apt-get build-dep php5  # install the build dependencies
   3. in the sources directory, edit debian/rules
      add --with-ldap-sasl and --with-mcrypt to the COMMON_CONFIG
      list of options
   4. In the root of the source directory, run debuild -us -uc
   5. Eat a sandwich while PHP compiles. This takes approximately 40
      minutes on a recent HP server in the lab.
   6. Install the .deb files placed in the directory above the source
      directory (dpkg -i ../*deb)
   7. Restart apache2
   
   It is necessary to complete these compilation steps for every PHP
   upgrade.

PHP Configuration:
   In addition to the custom compilation, several PHP options need to
   be changed in order for iodine to work correctly:
   These settings should be set in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:
   * expose_php = Off
   * max_execution_time = 120
   * max_input_time = 600
   * memory_limit = 86M
   * log_errors = On
   * ignore_repeated_errors = On
   * html_errors = Off
   * register_long_arrays = Off
   * register_argc_argv = Off
   * post_max_size = 256M
   * magic_quotes_gpc = Off
   * include_path = ".:/usr/share/php/smarty/libs:/usr/share/php"
   * enable_dl = On
   * upload_max_filesize = 256M
   * date.timezone = 'America/New_York'
   * session.gc_probability = 1
   * asession.gc_maxlifetime = 3600
     3600 must be larger than the iodine session timeout
