New Machine Setup Notes
=======================

Dependencies:
   * Apache
   * PHP (see notes below)
   * Heimdal kerberos
   * latex, dvips, latex2rtf, pdflatex
   * zip, unzip
   * cifs / smb
   * pecl-memcache / memcached
   * smarty
   * mariadb

PHP Modules:
	PHP must be built with
	USE="mysqli curl ldap xmlwriter imap"

PHP Configuration:
   Several PHP options need to
   be changed in order for iodine to work correctly:
   These settings should be set in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:
   * expose_php = Off
   * max_execution_time = 120
   * max_input_time = 600
   * memory_limit = 86M
   * log_errors = On
   * ignore_repeated_errors = On
   * html_errors = Off
   * register_long_arrays = Off
   * register_argc_argv = Off
   * post_max_size = 256M
   * magic_quotes_gpc = Off
   * enable_dl = On
   * upload_max_filesize = 256M
   * date.timezone = 'America/New_York'
   * session.gc_probability = 1
   * session.gc_maxlifetime = 3600
     3600 must be larger than the iodine session timeout

LDAP Configuration:
   In order to have LDAP not barf all over you, you have to have the 
   following schema included:
   * core
   * cosine (if you have sound support)
   * nis
   * inetorgperson
   * dyngroup
   * iodine
   If you fail to have one of these imported, slapd will segfault
   without any error messages. You then need to add a line to include
   intranet's slapd.acl. This also has a possibility of bringing
   about silent segfaults; it is recommended to do this one step at
   a time.
