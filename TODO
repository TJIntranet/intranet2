Things that need to be done (if a name is attributed to something, it doesn't
mean you can't help, just ask that person before changing the whole thing):

- 8th period system, in general (will expand to finer points later)

- Student directory system, with privacy options

- News needs to be touched up some more, probably

- We need some kind of design to work with (Eric)

- MySQL's select() needs to be changed to accept a straight string with
  printf-style input validation

- phpDoc needs to be run on the code to generate the API

- The phpDoc comments need to be refined, and more need to be added (Deason)
 
- The MySQL tables need to be created according to the scripts in mysql/
  (Deason)
