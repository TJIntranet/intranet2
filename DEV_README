We are currently using Mercurial for source management.  DO NOT use cvs.
To pull from a remote location, the command is 'hg pull ssh://humboldt.tjhsst.edu//shared/hg/intranet2'.

To get started:
mkdir intranet2
cd intranet2
hg init
hg pull /shared/hg/intranet2
hg update

To commit:
./commit
Arguments passed to ./commit will be passed to hg commit ([options] [filenames])

To update:
./update
Arguments passed to ./update will be passed to hg update ([options] [revision to get])

Note that these tools will update or commit your ENTIRE repository.  ./commit can be passed filenames or directories as arguments, but ./update cannot.  So, please excercise caution.

Also, note that files you create won't be committed until you use 'hg add' on them.

DO NOT use 'hg addremove'.  It will commit your personal config files to the global repository.  Please don't do that.

The shortcuts 'i2' and 'intranet2' are available for your use.  You can type 'hg pull i2', 'hg push intranet2', etc.  The default may also be i2, so you can tr typing 'hg pull' and seeing what happens.

The suggested way of working is to 'hg pull ssh://[username]@humboldt.tjhsst.edu//shared/hg/intranet2' from home, and push the same way.  You obviously need to install hg (and preferably meld) on your home computer to do this.  Mercurial depends on Python 2.3 or better.  By the time you are reading this, the entire system should be available on the CSL workstations for your working pleasure.  Remember to change config.ini's ROOT setting to the appropriate access URL if you're not working on humboldt.

Summary of things you need installed to work AND RUN i2 from home:
- Apache
- PHP5 with mod_php
- mod_rewrite  
- Python 2.3
- Meld, xxdiff, or the like type of decent merge program 
- Mercurial
- MySQL: you need the user iodine, with password 'br0m1n3', and the database 'iodine'.

You'll only be able to log in as 'guest', unless you hack kinit.  Remember to source the MySQL files in mysql/ to create the necessary databases.

If you only wish to code at home, and to test on humboldt, you may take advantage of a feature of Mercurial: repository-to-repository pushing.  At home, you can run 'hg push ssh://[username]@humboldt.tjhsst.edu/intranet2' to push changes into your humboldt home directory.  HOWEVER, this only pushes to the .hg repository over there.  It won't update your working copy.  So, you can either run 'hg update' on humboldt or use './test' (after running setup.home) to rsync a testing version up.  You need rsync, obviously.  Remember to 'hg commit' before pushing.  When you're ready to push your changes to the global repository, push to humboldt't /shared/hg/intranet2 dir as before.

If you work from home this way, all you'll need is a merge program and Mercurial (which, remember, requires Python >= 2.3).  If you're using Windows it may work for you, but Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) is advisable.

To make things easier, go ahead and set up an hgrc file, or just run setup.home to have one made automagically for you.  See 'man hgrc'.  Verbose=true under the UI section is highly recommended.  If you have setup.home do it, 'hg push testing' or just 'hg push' will push to your personal humboldt repository, while 'hg push i2' will have your code go global.  If your username at home is different from at school, you'll need to edit ~/.hgrc and fix the references to be your humboldt username.

Additionally, there are two ways to PULL the current Intranet2 copy: HTTP and SSH.  'hg pull http://iodine.tjhsst.edu/hg' will get the latest via HTTP - SSH is detailed above.  You cannot push to http, but since it doesn't require a password and is faster, you should use it for all your pulls.  After running ./setup.home, 'hg pull' will be HTTP, 'hg pull http' will be HTTP, 'hg pull i2' will be SSH, 'hg pull intranet2' will be SSH, and 'hg push' will be SSH.  You can just watch where Mercurial says it's pushing to/pulling from.

If you make changes and somebody else has already made changes at the same time, 'hg update' will tell you that there all multiple branches.  You have two choices at this point: 'hg update -C' will forget ALL your changes and take the local-repository version instead.  Usually, you won't want to do this.  Instead, 'hg update -m' will merge your changes.  If you don't have a merge program on the computer you're using (ie you're sshing to humboldt), you'll get a VERY ugly console merge program.  The idea is this: make the repository look like the end result you want, and then run 'hg commit'.  It'll say it's a "branch merge".  Everything will be happy.  A quick summary to merging changes:

1. hg pull
2. hg update -m
3. Merge the changes
4. hg commit the result
5. hg push

Voila, you're done!  This method will let you merge as many branches as you like into one.

Config:

To configure Intranet2 for use in your local directory, just run ./setup .
If changes are made to the htaccess or config.ini files by others, then you
will need to run this script again. If suddenly everything stops working, try
running that script to see if it makes things work again.

To create documentation:

Run 'makedoc.sh' in the root directory of your intranet2 copy, preferably the
one that's in your web-docs, for reasons below.

makedoc.sh reads the files from the current directory and places the
documentation in ../doc relative to the current directory. So, if you're in
~/web-docs/i2/, it will place the documentation in ~/web-docs/doc/, so now it's
easily accessible from your iodine /~username space (that's why you should be
in your web-docs).

This creates documentation for your personal space. Overall documentation will
be generated every once in a while by someone who has root access on humboldt.
