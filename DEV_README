Well, if you're here, you've gotten to getting CVSROOT set up and checking out in CVS. Here's a few notes to keep in mind:

This is the module team list as of January 7, 2005:

Error: 		adeason*, vmircea, aparthum, eharmon
Logging: 	vmircea*, adeason, mlee1, melthon, jboning
Authentication: lburton*, vmircea, jbreese, nkolia, sgross, asmith1
User: 		kgallagh*, vmircea, bfleming, lburton, sgross
MySQL: 		nkolia*, braujac, lhsu, kgallagh, asmith1, astebbin
Display: 	braujac*, eharmon, lhsu, aparthum

The star denotes your module team leader. Pleas talk to them and communicate with each other. Stay tuned to when http://iodine.tjhsst.edu/ is unblocked. I hope that there we can keep everyone uptodate on issues instead of this file. I will move parts of http://www.tjhsst.edu/~dtran/intranet2/ there when everything is ready.

Again, stay tuned, and happy coding.

If you need to edit something, please use the command 'cvs edit [filename]' first.  This is important.

After you edit something, make sure to either do a 'cvs commit' or 'cvs unedit' on it, so you don't stay in the editors list forever. And to see if people are editing a file, use 'cvs editors [filename]' to get a list of people currently editing a file.
