We are currently using Mercurial for source management.  DO NOT use cvs.
To pull from a remote location, the command is 'hg pull ssh://humboldt.tjhsst.edu//shared/hg/intranet2'.

To get started:
mkdir intranet2
cd intranet2
hg init
hg pull /shared/hg/intranet2
hg update

To commit:
./commit

To update:
./update

Note that these tools will update or commit your ENTIRE repository.  They don't care if you pass them file names or directories.  So, please excercise caution.

Config:

To configure Intranet2 for use in your local directory, just run ./setup .
If changes are made to the htaccess or config.ini files by others, then you
will need to run this script again. If suddenly everything stops working, try
running that script to see if it makes things work again.

To create documentation:

Run 'makedoc.sh' in the root directory of your intranet2 copy, preferably the
one that's in your web-docs, for reasons below.

makedoc.sh reads the files from the current directory and places the
documentation in ../doc relative to the current directory. So, if you're in
~/web-docs/i2/, it will place the documentation in ~/web-docs/doc/, so now it's
easily accessible from your iodine /~username space (that's why you should be
in your web-docs).

This creates documentation for your personal space. Overall documentation will
be generated every once in a while by someone who has root access on humboldt.
