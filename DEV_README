To start up your local CVS copy, run 'cvs co intranet2' in some directory, and
the files will be in the 'intranet2' sub-directory.

Directory hierarchy:
/modules/ -- most PHP goes in here. Any module, core, or helper classes go here.
/www/ -- Files that are always accessible to users, with no need for auth.
/templates/ -- Smarty template files.
/mysql/ -- Scripts for making/defining the mysql tables.
/smarty/ -- PHP files for defining custom smarty tags and functions.

We are currently using Mercurial for source management.  DO NOT use cvs.

To get started:
mkdir intranet2
cd intranet2
hg init
hg pull /shared/hg/intranet2
hg update

To commit:
./commit

To update:
./update

Note that these tools will update or commit your ENTIRE repository.  They don't care if you pass them file names or directories.  So, please excercise caution.

Config:

- You need to copy .htaccess.user and config.user.ini into .htaccess and
  config.ini, respectively, and edit them in order to config Iodine correctly.

- If you make a change to the config or the RewriteRules, then please commit
  changes in both the user and server file.

To create documentation:

Run 'makedoc.sh' in the root directory of your intranet2 copy, preferably the
one that's in your web-docs, for reasons below.

makedoc.sh reads the files from the current directory and places the
documentation in ../doc relative to the current directory. So, if you're in
~/web-docs/i2/, it will place the documentation in ~/web-docs/doc/, so now it's
easily accessible from your iodine /~username space (that's why you should be
in your web-docs).

This creates documentation for your personal space. Overall documentation will
be generated every once in a while by someone who has root access on humboldt.
