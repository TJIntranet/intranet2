To start up your local CVS copy, run 'cvs co intranet2' in some directory, and
the files will be in the 'intranet2' sub-directory.

Directory hierarchy:
/modules/ -- most PHP goes in here. Any module, core, or helper classes go here.
/www/ -- Files that are always accessible to users, with no need for auth.
/templates/ -- Smarty template files.
/mysql/ -- Scripts for making/defining the mysql tables.
/smarty/ -- PHP files for defining custom smarty tags and functions.

General CVS guidelines:

- Run 'cvs update' to grab the latest code from CVS into your local directory
- Run 'cvs edit <file>' before editing a file, then edit it how you wish
- Run 'cvs commit [file]' to commit a file to CVS (omitting the file just
  commits everything edited so far in the current PWD and subdirectories), but
  make sure to run 'cvs update' before you commit things to make sure other
  things haven't changed since you edited the file.
- Run 'cvs unedit <file>' if you want to undo all changes you've made to a file,
  or if you haven't made any changes, then it just tells CVS that you have no
  intention of doing so.

Config:

- You need to copy .htaccess.user and config.user.ini into .htaccess and
  config.ini, respectively, and edit them in order to config Iodine correctly.

- If you make a change to the config or the RewriteRules, then please commit
  changes in both the user and server file.

To create documentation:

Run 'makedoc.sh' in the root directory of your intranet2 copy, preferably the
one that's in your web-docs, for reasons below.

makedoc.sh reads the files from the current directory and places the
documentation in ../doc relative to the current directory. So, if you're in
~/web-docs/i2/, it will place the documentation in ~/web-docs/doc/, so now it's
easily accessible from your iodine /~username space (that's why you should be
in your web-docs).

This creates documentation for your personal space. Overall documentation will
be generated every once in a while by someone who has root access on humboldt.
