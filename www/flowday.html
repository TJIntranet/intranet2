Learn why sometimes it's exactly those endeavors many people think reside outside the realm of 'normal' that lead you straight to the door of your inner flow, where anything is possible and creativity abounds. We hope to show you what the world looks like between thinking you can't and learning you can.

I mean, how many people can say that they were President of a high school club that ran an event at a full-fledged University attended by 2000 people that cost $22,000? I hope I'm the only one. As President of Namaste, especially during Junior year, I, and my fellow team members, had to (and will have to) work late nights, stay after school, exchange literally hundreds of emails with Sra. Pou, and make seemingly trivial (but extremely important) decisions for the entire year. It's a delicate balance, but it's life - and I feel the TJ community would love to hear about how I, and my team, worked through the pressures of TJ and how our story is something that is applicable to the other pressures that students face. <br><b>Presenter:&nbsp; Dhruv Gupta<br> Room: 250<br><br><br></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent:-.25in;"><b>12.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>To Follow the 'Recipe'...or Not?</b> Just as a baker follows a certain recipe to produce delectable, favorable treats, many of us have followed a societal 'recipe' that outlines the way to becoming the 'perfect student'.

Laws and rules are just explicit norms. Therefore, if you are trying to discover pollution, the norm (law) against dumping toxic waste into your local river is – in fact – a very positive check on your discovery. On the other hand, some norms manifest as strong social pressures for or against certain pursuits by certain people. For many decades, American norms held that women suited only for household, clerical, or healthcare work. Thankfully, Ann Dunwoody, Ginni Rometty, Carol Greider, and many others are proving how stupid that norm was.&nbsp; Instead of trying to apply a blanket approach to every rule, we will discuss (with cases) how you can apply critical, contextualized thinking to norms in order to understand which ones you should bend, break, and follow.<br><b>Presenter:&nbsp; Ted Zagraniski<br> Room: Galileo Commons<br><br><br><br></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><b>17.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b><i>The Joy of International Travel. </i></b>Traveling outside of your own home country and culture is among the most mentally stimulating and rewarding experiences you can have in life.&nbsp; Learn about the benefits and unexpected pleasures of international travel.&nbsp; (Features NEW vacation photos from Dr. Smith's own travel.)<br><b>Presenter:&nbsp; Adam Smith<br> Room: Tesla Commons</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.25in;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><b>18.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Beyond TJ: Finding your niche. </b>&nbsp;A brief talk on my post-TJ experience, discovering &amp; following new passions, and self care.<br><b>Presenter: Darcey Pancoast<br> Room: DaVinci<br><br><br></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">19.<span style="font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>Humor in a Digital Age:</b> &nbsp;YouTube, Twitter, Memes, GIFs, and good times.&nbsp; How I use humor to make information dissemination more fun and maintain my unique voice.&nbsp; <br><b>Presenter:&nbsp; Scott Campbell<br> Room: Einstein Commons<br><br><br></b></p><p></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">20.<span style="font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>Why You Shouldn’t Do What I Did</b> Teaching was the best thing that ever happened to me, but because I attended TJ, I didn't do it right away, and if it weren't for fate and luck, I might never have done it at all.<br><b>Presenter:&nbsp; Michael Auerbach<br> Room: 141<br><br><br></b></p><p></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><b>21.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Comics Are Cool, And You Should Be Reading Them. </b>Often criticized as being only for children and unable to have any depth or value, comics are a severely undervalued medium in society.

We live in a society and economy that demand modernization and technological advances, and there is significant societal pressure to keep up, to have a skill in a STEM field. But does pursuing math or engineering mean you have to give up on creative interests? We'll talk how to apply soft skills to hard science, how to figure out our true interests, and how I found a career path that ticked both the creative and technical boxes. <br><b>Presenter:&nbsp; Carey Russell<br> Room: T34</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-right:.25in;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-right:.25in;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;"><b>33.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b><i>Nobody cares about your career....more than you: How to forge your own path in the corporate machine. </i></b>There are a myriad of benefits to taking a job with a large established company straight out of school.&nbsp; You can count on job stability, room to grow, a great benefits package, and easy assess to training opportunities.&nbsp; What you don't count on is the anonymity - of being almost interchangeable with other entry level employees.&nbsp; It's something that hit me hard initially, but also forced me to learn to be my own #1 advocate for my future and that when it comes to your career it's OK to be a little bit selfish. I learned how to turn menial grunt work tasks into opportunities to prove my worth and later as leverage when making requests to higher ups.&nbsp; By being honest, open, up front and frankly, ballsy, I have successfully maneuvered my way through three distinctly different roles within the company. What did I learn? Not to feel guilty for leaving behind a project or project team when a new opportunity comes along and more importantly that construction isn't for me long term.&nbsp; More importantly I learned how to move forward when a job isn't fulfilling and to keep trying until I end up doing something I truly love.&nbsp; What's next for me? Leaving my job and moving to Europe for 2 years to earn a masters degree in Offshore Engineering from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands to jumpstart a career in offshore renewables.&nbsp; <b></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.25in;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presenter:&nbsp; MC Anderson</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.25in;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room: T35<br><br></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:10pt;margin-left:-.25in;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><b>34.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Running for Local Office (and why it matters) </b>Heeding the call to local office may not seem as most highly sought-after or glorious of career moves, it is however vitally important to our everyday lives. Although only approximately 25% of our residents will vote in local elections in 2015, the elections will impact the future of our schools and of our community.&nbsp; After years of working as a teacher and as a communications specialist, Dalia started to see that the leadership in Fairfax County Public Schools needed to better represent the needs of the current and future generations of students. That is why, as a graduate of FCPS (including TJ) and as a world language teacher, she decided to do something about it by running for the School Board in 2015.&nbsp; At this presentation, you can hear about what led to this decision, what it takes to run for local office, and what you can do to get involved in local politics. Even though you may only hear about our state and national representatives, our local officials are working hard everyday to ensure that our county continues to thrive.<b><br> Presenter:&nbsp; Dalia Palchik<br> Room: T6</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.25in;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  <p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-right:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><b>35.<span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman';'="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Projects Abroad. </b>I had always wanted to travel to Fiji South Pacific but did not want to have the typical tourist experience.
