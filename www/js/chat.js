// This is where chat for intranet will be implemented. It's basically a javascript IRC client
// Which connects to a specific server, allowing it to communicate in a way that's already pretty
// well-defined. Also, it saves us the effort of designing a better protocol, not to mention
// getting iodine up to the speed necessary to run an AJAX chat in real time.
