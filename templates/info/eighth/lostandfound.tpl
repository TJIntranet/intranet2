<h1>"What is the Lost and Found Club?"</h1>

<p>After each set of 3 unexcused 8th period absences, students will be assigned to the Lost and Found Club, otherwise know as "in-house detention."   0nce students are assigned to the club, they will have 1 day to fix any mistaken unexcused absence with their teacher(s).  If the absences are not excused, then the student should be assigned to a double block of Lost and Found quiet study hall (no talking, eating, or sleeping).  Students may not be excused from Lost and Found Club for any reason.  Failure to show up for the whole period will result in a Saturday detention where students will spend time improving the school grounds.</p>
