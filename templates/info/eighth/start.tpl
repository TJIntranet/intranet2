<p>To start a club or new organization which will meet during 8th period or after school you must follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Check the list of existing clubs, both active and inactive, to determine if a club similar to the idea you have in mind has been previously approved.</li>
   <li>Ask a current staff member to be a faculty/staff representative.  Parent volunteers may serve in this capacity only if they have completed FCPS requirements for fingerprinting, TB Tine testing and have submitted letters of recommendation.  Application forms for volunteer sponsors are available in the 8th period office  (236wk)</li>
   <li>If no existing club fits your criteria, obtain a New Club Application form (NCA) from the 8th period activities office.</li>
   <li>Complete the form by providing an accurate description of the philosophy, objectives, and any fundraising information of the club.</li>
   <li>Attach to the NCA form a list of 20 students signatures, indicating that they would be willing to attend the club on a regular basis. Return these forms to the 8th period office.</li>
</ul>

<p>All new club/activity applications must be submitted by <b>Oct. 31</b>.</p>

<p>The Director of Student Activities will verify that the club is in compliance with Fairfax County School Board policy and meets the requirements for an approved activity.  If it is not, a process will be started to gain compliance.  This may take a few weeks and the club may not meet during the interim.  When the club is sanctioned, meetings will be scheduled.  The adult representative and the 8th Period Activities Co-coordinator will assume responsibility for listing the club meetings online.</p>

<p>The same process will be needed to gain approval for a club that will not meet during 8th period.  The group will still have to be approved by the director of Student Activities in order to use the building or any of its facilities</p>
