<h1>How to Start a Club</h1>

To start a club or new organization which will meet during 8th period or after school you must follow these guidelines: 

<ul>
      <li>Check in the 8th period office to determine if a club similar to the idea you have in mind, has been previously approved.</li>

      <li>Ask a current staff member to be a faculty/staff representative.  Parent volunteers may serve in this capacity only if they have completed FCPS requirements for fingerprinting, TB Tine testing and have submitted letters of recommendation.  Application forms for volunteer sponsors are available in the 8th period office - (236wk)</li>

      <li>If no existing club fits your criteria, then request the appropriate forms from an 8th period a office staff member.  The forms will be sent to you via e-mail</li>

      <li>Complete the forms on the computer, then print them out and return them to the 8th period office.</li>

      <li>All new club/activity applications must be submitted by Oct. 31.</li>
</ul>

Once the application is returned to the 8th period office, the application follows this path for approval:

<ul>
      <li>Director of Student Activities</li>

      <li>Principal</li>

      <li>Director of Student Activities for FCPS</li>
</ul>

All three individuals must approve the club application. The approval process typically takes 2 - 3 weeks
