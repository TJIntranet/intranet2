<h1>How to Start a Club</h1>

To start a club or new organization which will meet during 8th period or after school you must follow these guidelines: 

<ul>
      <li>Check in the Activities Office by the main gym with the Assistant Director of Student Activities (David Gardziel for 2007-08) to determine if a club similar to the idea you have in mind, has been previously approved.</li>

      <li>If no existing club fits your criteria, then request the appropriate forms from Mr. Gardziel. The forms will be sent to you via e-mail.</li>
      
      <li>Ask a current staff member to be a faculty/staff representative.</li>

      <li>Complete the forms on the computer, then print them out and return them to the Activities Office by the main gym: attn: David Gardziel.</li>

      <li>All new club/activity applications must be submitted by Oct. 31.</li>
</ul>

Once the application is returned to the Activities Office, the application follows this path for approval:

<ul>
      <li>Director of Student Activities</li>

      <li>Principal</li>

      <li>Director of Student Activities for FCPS</li>
</ul>

All three individuals must approve the club application. The approval process typically takes 2 - 3 weeks
