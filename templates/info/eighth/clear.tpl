<h1>How to Clear an Absence</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Sign on to your Intranet Account.</li>
  <li>Under the words "8th period: today's date" you will see how many times you have been absent.</li>
  <li>Click on that number and you will see exactly which dates and blocks that you were marked absent.</li>
  <li>Print the page.</li>
  <li>Bring the page to the 8th Period office - room 236 wk - for attendance verification.  A member of the 8th period staff will check the appropriate attendance roster to confirm attendance.</li>
  <li>If you know you forgot to sign in, take it to the teacher of that activity and ask the teacher to sign the sheet saying that you were indeed present.</li>
  <li>Stay current with your 8th period attendance record.  An absence can only be cleared within 14 days of the date of the absence.</li>
</ul>
