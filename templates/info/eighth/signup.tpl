<h1>How to Sign up for Eighth Period</h1>

<strong>Selecting an Activity:</strong>

<p>
Activity selections are expected to be made by the end of lunch on the day of the activity. The sign up process can be done in three ways. 
</p>

<strong>First Method: (Online)</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Go online to the TJ Homepage (www.tjhsst.edu)</li>
    <li>Click on the Intranet link (located under the school address, next to the word "Navigation")</li>
    <li>Once the intranet log-in window appears type in your log-in name and your password.  The intranet will not accept your school ID# as your password.  It is very important to change your password as soon as possible during the first week of school</li>
    <li>On the left side of the screen, under the word TJ INTRANET you will find "8th Period" followed by today's date. First you will see the number of absences that are currently recorded for you.  If you click on that number you can see exactly what date the absence occurred.
    <ul><li>Click on "Full Schedule" to see all of the offerings for the next 8 weeks.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>To sign up for an activity for a specific date and block click on the word "Change" next to a date and block. A window will pop up with all the possible choices for that block.  To learn more about any particular activity click on the name of the activity. A description of that activity will pop up. Click on as many as you wish - one at a time.  If you wish to register for activity, click on "Change."  If you decide against that choice highlight a different activity and continue the process until you find something you like.  Use the green "back" arrow on your browser toolbar to navigate between pages.</li>
    <li>To sign up for the same activity multiple times (for several days or blocks), click on the box next to the word "change" for each date or block that you wish to change.  Then at the top of the page click on the button marked "Change Selected," highlight the activity, click on "Change" and all of the blocks that you have checked off will be changed to that activity, provided they are scheduled for those dates.</li>
</ul>

 

<strong>Advantages to this method:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>You can sign up for an activity at any time, from home or school.</li>
    <li>You can sign up for activities days in advance.</li>
    <li>You can view your schedule, read about upcoming specials, learn more about a particular club or activity and see your 8th period attendance record.</li>
</ul>

 

<strong>Second Method:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Come in to the 8th Period Office and make your change request in person.  A member of the 8th Period Office staff will enter the information for you.</li>
</ul>

 

<strong>Advantages to this method:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>If an activity is full you can discuss alternatives with an 8th period staff member.</li>
</ul>

 

<strong>Activities Attendance:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Because 8th period is part of the school day the school must account for the whereabouts of each student during this time. Attendance is recorded for each activity.</li>

    <li>After each set of 3 unexcused 8th period absences, students will be assigned to the Lost and Found Club.  Once students are assigned to the club, they will have 2 weeks to fix any mistaken unexcused absence with their teacher(s).  If the absences are not excused, then the student will be assigned to a double block of Lost and Found quiet study hall (no talking, eating, or sleeping).  Students may not be excused from Lost and Found Club for any reason.  Failure to show up for the whole period will result in a Saturday detention where students will spend time improving the school grounds.</li>
