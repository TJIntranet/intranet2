<h1>How to Sign up for Eighth Period</h1>

<strong>Selecting an Activity:</strong>

<p>Activity selections are expected to be made by the end of lunch on the day of the activity.  The sign up process can be done in three ways.</p>

<strong>First Method - Online:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>At the top of the Intranet, click the word &ldquo;Eighth&rdquo; to see your upcoming eighth periods</li>
    <li>To sign up for an activity for a specific date and block click on the word &ldquo;Change&rdquo; next to a date and block.  You will see a list of the activities that block.  To learn more about any particular activity click on the name of the activity.  If you wish to register for activity, click on the &ldquo;Change&rdquo; button after selecting an activity.  If you select &ldquo;View Roster,&rdquo; you can see who has signed up for that activity (assuming they agreed to make that visible); use the &ldquo;back&rdquo; arrow in your browser to return to the list.</li>
    <li>To sign up for the same activity multiple times (for several days or blocks), click the check boxes on the rows for the blocks you wish to change.  Then, at the top, click on the button marked &ldquo;Change Selected,&rdquo; and choose an activity from the list as described above.  All the blocks you checked will be changed to that activity, provided the activity is scheduled for those dates.</li>
</ul> 

<strong>Advantages to this method:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>You can sign up for an activity at any time, anywhere.</li>
    <li>You can sign up for activities days in advance.</li>
    <li>You can view your schedule, read about upcoming specials, learn more about a particular club or activity and see your 8th period attendance record.</li>
</ul>

 

<strong>Second Method - In the 8<sup>th</sup> Period Office:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Come in to the 8<sup>th</sup> Period Office and make your change request in person.  A member of the 8<sup>th</sup> Period Office staff will enter the information for you.</li>
    <li>Be aware that the 8<sup>th</sup> period office can get very busy on 8<sup>th</sup> period days, so you may have to wait.  If you do not have questions you need be answered in person, consider signing up online (see the <strong>First Method</strong>, above).</li>
</ul>

<strong>Advantages to this method:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>If an activity is full you can discuss alternatives with an 8<sup>th</sup> period staff member.</li>
</ul>

 

<strong>Activities Attendance:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Because 8<sup>th</sup> period is part of the school day the school must account for the whereabouts of each student during this time. Attendance is recorded for each activity.</li>
    <li>After each set of 3 unexcused 8<sup>th</sup> period absences, students will be assigned to the Lost and Found Club.  Once students are assigned to the club, they will have 2 weeks to fix any mistaken unexcused absence with their teacher(s).  If the absences are not excused, then the student will be assigned to a double block of Lost and Found quiet study hall (no talking, eating, or sleeping).  Students may not be excused from Lost and Found Club for any reason.  Failure to show up for the whole period will result in a Saturday detention where students will spend time improving the school grounds.</li>

</ul>
