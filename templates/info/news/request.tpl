<h1>Submitting a news article for posting</h1>
<p>You can request a news post be submitted by clicking the &ldquo;Submit a news article for posting&rdquo; link at the top of the news page.  You will be presented with a form where you can write your news request.</p>
<p>Every news post <u>must</u> have a title and expiration date in addition to the post itself.  Posts can also be made visible only to specific groups (e.g., only students in a certain grade, or of a certain gender).</p>
<p>It is important to note that every news post must be approved by a TJ staff member <u>and</u> an Intranet administrator before it will be posted.  The news posting request page includes a list of instructions to follow to increase the chances of your post being approved quickly.</p>
