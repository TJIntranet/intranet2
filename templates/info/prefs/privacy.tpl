<h1>Privacy Options</h1>

<p>The privacy settings section allows you to control the parts of your profile other students can view.</p>
<p>Note that you can only allow a section of your profile if your parent/guardian authorized it on the form sent home at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that, while you can limit what other students see, staff can always access all your information.</p>
