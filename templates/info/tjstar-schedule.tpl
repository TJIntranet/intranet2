			George Washington University<br>
			Exploration of Energy Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Magnetic Refrigeration Systems<br><br>
			This work experimentally explores and theoretically models an eco-friendly and energy efficient magnetic refrigeration system (replacing conventional compression system) capable of operating at wide range of temperatures. For this system, a user-defined temperature controller has been manually designed to accurately control the system's working area temperature, and an innovative magnetic refrigeration test bed capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures was also developed. This system platform allows the performance evaluation of various design parameters including: (i) the magnetocaloric effect of magnetic refrigerants, (ii) the structural geometries of magnetic refrigerants, and (iii) the optimization of transient magnetocaloric regeneration processes. Incorporating the experimental data from this system with theoretical modeling of phase coexistence, an initial physics-based mathematical model has been developed to numerically describe the magnetocaloric effect within meta-magnetic materials exhibiting strong potential as viable magnetic refrigerants.<br><br>

			Mr. Pratik Pandey<br>

			Dr. Qi Yang<br>
			Director<br>
			Caliper Corporation<br>
			Play with Traffic using Simulation<br><br>
			Traffic congestion is getting worse almost in every city around world. All kind policies and advanced traffic management systems have been devised to increase mobility and reduce travel delays. But how do you know if a proposed plan would work? Construction of roads and highways, subways and stations are expensive. You cannot build them and rebuild them like playing with Legos, but you may study and analyze a proposed system and policy using simulation. We will discuss the development of TransModeler - a sophisticated traffic simulation model geared to help city planners and traffic engineers to solve their traffic problems.<br><br>

	 a ubiquitous consumer product. Here are few examples.
	GPS satellites use ultra precise atomic clocks, and satellite design accounts for effects of special and general relativity theory.
	A GPS receiver must track a weak signal that is buried in noise, is delayed by going through space plasma and is corrupted by reflecting from nearby buildings.
	Your position is calculated by solving sophisticated nonlinear equations.
	Map matching and route computation use advanced algorithms from statistics and from the graph theory.
	In short, directions for your drive to a dance party were made possible by the expertise, knowledge and creativity of thousands of scientists and engineers.

		<td style="vertical-align: top; border:1px solid #aaa;">Recently, we made an exciting, and very unexpected discovery - human fat cells (adipocytes) could make ample amounts of melanin, black pigment usually found in the skin. Melanin is a remarkable compound. It has an ability to scavenge
	 reactive oxygen species and suppress inflammation. When induced in human fat, it may make fat inert by preventing its from producing inflammatory compounds exerting detrimental action at the heart, liver and other organs. Thus, we hope that, in the future,
	 simple pill-based treatment may be taken by obese and overweight to delay the development of various obesity-associated chronic diseases and to provide substantial savings of the medical costs associated with the treatment of these diseases.<br><br>

		<td style="vertical-align: top; border:1px solid #aaa;">Intellectual property falls into three main categories: Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights. Copyrights cover film, music
	and written materials. Trademarks covers identifying logos and patterns. Patents cover inventions of compositions, processes and machines/devices. Patent Examiners do important work that supports our country&#8217;s economy. Examination takes considerable analytical
	 skills and creativity in a time sensitive environment. You need to have a strong science or engineering background and then learn how to search and apply patent law. Patent Attorneys have similar backgrounds and skill sets. Both careers provide a satisfying
	 intellectual challenge and an admittedly comfortable income. <br><br>

		<td style="vertical-align: top; border:1px solid #aaa;" >The future outlook for careers in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields is very promising for young people right now. With more than half of the scientists and engineers in the United States currently
	 older than 45 there will be a massive retirement of these skilled workers during the next 20 years, and therefore a strong demand for younger workers with STEM skills. This presentation will discuss the current STEM workforce trends and provide guidance on
	 how to find out the STEM career that is right for you.<br><br>

		<td style="vertical-align: top; border:1px solid #aaa;">Spies have used social engineering for centuries. For example, a spy may observe a target&#8217;s movement and behavioral
	pattern every Saturday morning. In doing so he might notice that the target goes to a particular coffee shop every Saturday at 10 AM, reads the Wall Street Journal and strolls through the adjacent farmer&#8217;s market.
	The spy could then strategically place himself at the coffee shop and strike up a seemingly innocent conversation with the target about the nearby farmer&#8217;s market or an article in the newspaper.
	Once a bond is formed between the spy and the target, the spy can easily manipulate the target into divulging confidential or personal information, such as where the target works or if the target is married, without raising any flags.
	That is social engineering. <br>
	<br>
	Now enter cyberspace, a domain flooded with readily available personal information. Cyber criminals will try to manipulate their targets to click malicious links, which would give the cyber criminal unfettered access to the target&#8217;s system or network.
	These cyber criminals use social networks to target their attacks. Have a Facebook account?
	Chances are you do. Even if you have selected the highest privacy settings Facebook offers, your account is likely still linked to your real name, picture, and possibly your general geographic location.
	What about LinkedIn? A simple search of your name and general location, paired with the information gleaned from Facebook, and cyber criminals have everything they need.<br>
	<br>
	Knowing a target&#8217;s employer is a jackpot for the social engineer, which makes LinkedIn especially dangerous.
	Would you open an e-mail sent from an address similar to your company&#8217;s?
	What if the e-mail was addressed to you and cc&#8217;d to your boss?
	Would you open it, and then click the link? Chances are very high that you would. Cyber criminals use these targeted phishing attacks (or spear-phishing) frequently, which have been made easier by the prevalence of social networks.
	Without these social networks, cyber criminals would have a much harder time discovering their target&#8217;s employer or position in the company.

	Speaker: Claire Egan<br>
	The purpose of my project is to determine the amount of dark matter in M31, the Andromeda galaxy, as a function of distance to Andromeda's center. I used rotation curves, which plot the velocity of stellar matter verse radius from the galactic center. Dark
	 matter is a mysterious material that does not emit any radiation and is non-luminous: it is a critical force in the universe today.<br><br>

	This study analyzes the degree of threat that solar radiation poses to the health of astronauts by comparing the amounts of different sources of radiation from galactic cosmic rays, x-rays, and gamma rays that are present in low-earth orbit. Data from
	 this study can be used to determine the most hazardous source(s) and to propose various solutions to limit astronaut exposure.<br><br>

	Title: The Effect of Jupiter System III Central Meridian Longitude and Io Phase on Jovian Radio Burst Storms<br>
	Speaker: Danbi Kim, Nicholas Skeen<br>
	While several studies have been conducted examining the dynamics governing the Jovian plasma system, these dynamics are very complicated and still not well-understood. Radio bursts are thought to be a product of electromagnetic interactions between distinct
	 active emission zones located near Jupiter&#8217;s poles and the flow of charge between Io and these zones. Bursts fall into two distinct categories when recorded on Earth: long (L-) bursts and short (S-) bursts; this investigation is aimed at qualifying relevant
	 patterns with respect to burst type and emission zone.<br><br>

	Title: Modeling the Invisible: Investigating the Radio Signature of Sagittarius A*<br>
	Speaker: Kalvin Harrigal<br>
	Sagittarius A* is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Black holes, the densest objects in the universe, emit no visible light and are thus difficult to study.
	Using radio images I am attempting to model behaviors of this elusive object.<br><br>

	Title: Observing Characteristics of Single-Pulse Pulsar Plots<br>
	Speaker: Victoria Kelley<br>
	My goal was to identify a means of discovering pulsars more easily.
	I examined single-pulse plots of known and potential pulsars.
	From looking at the data, I now have a better way of classifying future pulsars from looking at single-pulse plots.</td>

	A look at exoplanets, the characteristics of their orbits, and their star systems. In particular, this will focus on the differences between systems with fewer planets and systems with more planets. It will also consider how planetary temperatures can
	 be estimated, and what long-term orbital changes could potentially mean for planets near their stars' habitable zones, where life may occur.<br><br>

	Title: Solar Flare Action<br>
	Speaker: Deborah King, Kathryn DeWeese<br>
	Recently NASA has made an observation that approximately 15% of solar flares have an extra peak of energy after the solar flare has occurred. Scientists are currently not sure why this happens. We aim to find a pattern between which flares do have this extra
	 peak, and potentially even determine why this phenomenon takes place. According to NASA, without taking account for this extra peak, scientists would be underestimating the amount of energy coming towards the earth by up to 70%.<br><br>

	Title: Investigating the Birth Rate of Millisecond Pulsars in the Galaxy<br>
	Speaker: Thomas Hillenbrand<br>
	When a star runs out of elements to use in nuclear fusion, it can no longer support itself against the external forces of gravity and collapses down on itself. This event is also called going supernova. After all of the outer gas and material dissipates, all
	 that is left is a small, yet incredibly dense core. This core is held stable through the repulsive forces between electrons, or electron degeneracy. The resulting object is dubbed a white dwarf. In the event that the core has a mass too large for the electron
	 degeneracy to support it, it collapses further until only neutron degeneracy is supporting the object. At this stage, a neutron star has formed. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the neutron star (comparable to the size of Washington D.C.) is spinning
	 at an incredible speed, sometimes rotating hundreds of times per second.<br><br>

	Title: The Search for Pulsars<br>
	Speaker: Nathan Keithline<br>
	The race is on to search the skies for the elusive celestial bodies known as pulsars.
	Pulsars are highly magnetized remnants of supernovae that emit pulses of energy at regular intervals.
	First thought to be alien transmissions, these &quot;stars&quot; can help demonstrate many relativistic physical properties.</td>

	How did the ancient universe give rise to what we see today?
	How did galaxies evolve over eons into those like our very own Milky Way?
	This project seeks to determine the very structure of the universe by examining ancient, distant galaxies called quasars and determining whether they are clustered or not.<br><br>

	Title: Black Holes and X-Rays for Beginners<br>
	Speaker: Jacob Zucker<br>
	Have you ever wondered what exactly goes on in black holes? 
	Have you ever asked yourself what it would be like if there was a massive black hole near our sun?
	Ever been curious about x-ray bursts racing towards earth from deep space?
	My study tries to give answers to these profound questions in a way that students and high school teachers can understand and appreciate.
	My focus of study is Cygnus X-1, a binary star system containing an enormous star and a black hole.
	I take a look at how these two fascinating stellar objects interact, focusing on the energetic x-ray bursts the black hole emits.
	My study provides an easy to understand explanation directed at future students and tech lab researchers of some of the most exotic and intriguing features of the universe.

	 Vesta and have an idea of how our own planet Earth formed.<br><br>

	Title: Finding the Moon&#8217;s Lost Twin<br>
	Speaker: SeungIn Sohn<br>
	This project investigates the new hypothesis involving the creation of the Moon, which states that the current Moon may have come from two different moons that later collided with each other. This project uses seismological data from the ALSEPs (Apollo Lunar
	 Surface Experiment Packages) to identify the geological structure of the near side of the Moon and of the far side of the Moon and determine whether the hypothesis is valid. This hypothesis, if proven valid, will explain why the surface of the two sides are
	 very different from each other, and could give us more understanding of the creation of the Earth as well as that of the Moon.<br><br>

	Title: Isotopic Fractionation as a Biomarker on Mars<br>
	Speaker: Seema Mir<br>
	Calculated values of isotope ratios can indicate the existence of life on planets. My project was about analyzing processes that would cause the fractionation of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen on Mars and try determine if the processes showed that they resulted

	In disaster areas and war zones, unknown areas are highly dangerous.
	This autonomous robot uses SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to provide an accurate real-time map of a location.
	It utilizes sonar as the detection method.<br><br>

	Title: Development of an Autonomous Grasping and Tactile Sensing System<br>
	Speaker: Samuel Prestwood<br>
	The ability to grasp objects is a skill that many take for granted. Creating a system that emulates natural human grasping is a non-trivial task because it requires precise control and tactile feedback from a hand. The purpose of this project is develop and
	 assess the performance of an autonomous grasping and tactile sensing system.<br>

	Speaker: Pali Singh, Sarah Stites<br>
	Our project investigates the response of cancer cells to the combination of the hormone leptin and beta-estradiol, an estrogen. Leptin, a protein hormone, is known to have a role in cancer development, diabetes, obesity and other major diseases plaguing
	 many countries. The effects of the combination of of hormones is still unknown.<br><br>

	Title: Cytokines Involved in Red Blood Cell Distribution Width as a Prognostic Indicator Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis<br>
	Speaker: Taylor Reffett<br>
	I investigated cytokines involved in both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and erythropoiesis to determine why an increase in red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with a decreased prognosis in patients with IPF. ELISA assays were used to
	 study the levels of various cytokines in blood samples of patients with IPF. It is difficult to predict the course of this disease, and it may be possible to use RDW as a reliable and inexpensive tool for this purpose.<br><br>

	Title: Telomerase and Methyl RNA: The Missing Link in the Cure for Cancer<br>
	Speaker: Jesse Witkowski<br>
	Telomeres, the length if which is controlled by the enzyme telomerase, are what determine how many times a cell can replicate. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect a certain type of methyl RNA has on telomerase activation in pancreatic
	 cancer cells, which in turn could offer a means by which the replication of said cancerous cells could be limited.</td>

	Speaker: Abraham Avi Sachs<br>
	The viability of ethanol in the petroleum industry is largely compromised by the presence of the macromolecule lignin in glucose stock sources. There are few organisms that can effectively metabolize lignin, but several species of fungi produce an enzyme that
	 is capable of lignin catalysis. This project involves the transformation of E. coli with a novel plasmid carrying the gene for the lignin peroxidase enzyme.<br><br>

	Speaker: Aleena Ijaz, Faven Russom<br>
	Optogenetics, which aims to achieve control overgenetically engineered neurons using light, is a new and rapidly growing field. It is able to gain control over specific cell types and regions, leading to many clinical and research
	 applications. Most optogenetic experiments to date have used an opsin (or light sensing protein) called channelrhodopsin-2, which responds to blue light.
	In this experiment however, we will be inserting a photoreceptor called phytochrome, which responds to red light, into the neural cells of C. elegans. The phytochromes will be tagged with green fluorescent proteins in order to trace their efficacy throughout
	 the experiment. The discovery of a red light protein sensor for optogenetics would be useful because red light can penetrate deeper tissues.<br><br>

	Title: That Darn Tic!: Tic Generation in Tourette's Syndrome<br>
	Speaker: Karishma Popli<br>
	This study looks at tic generation in Tourette's Syndrome patients. Tourette&#8217;s Syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. These tics are thought to occur through an
	 excitation/inhibition imbalance in the brain that is linked to GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, levels in the brain. The results of this study have implications for possible neurological models and insight on the disease process of Tourette&#8217;s Syndrome.
	 With this finding, potential drug therapies could be targeted at increasing GABA levels in Tourette's patients' brains to cure tics associated with Tourette's Syndrome.<br><br>

	Title: HIV-1 Extracellular Interactions Using Exosomes<br>
	Speaker: Milan Patel<br>
	Currently, a novel method of intercellular interaction via exosomal secretion is being explored by many different scientists.
	Infectious virus particles have commonly been thought to either bud from the plasma membrane or be released from endosomes within cells. The exact mechanisms involved in exosomal release are, however, uncertain.
	Another facet of exosomes that remains unclear, in the context of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, is their ability to act as infectious agents themselves and induce host responses. The main purpose of these experiments is to purify
	 exosomes from uninfected and virally infected cells and analyze the composition for viral components as well as indications of virus production.</td>

	Speaker: Cynthia Chen<br>
	Green tea has been called beneficially healthy but the secret behind its health properties are in the tea&#8217;s catechins. Green tea catechins are anti-oxidants, meaning the catechins reduce and repair the effects of oxidation in cells or inhibit the oxidation
	 of other molecules. Oxidation is a process in which electrons are transferred from a substance to an oxidizing agent, and free radicals are produced. Free radicals in cells start reactions that could lead to damage or death of a cell. Green tea catechins could
	 prevent or inhibit various diseases linked to damage by free radicals, such as breast cancer. My project investigates how the anti-oxidant properties of the green tea catechin EGCg work as cancer therapeutic agents to prevent invasive breast cancer growth
	 by inhibiting the signaling of the MAPk proliferation pathway in breast cancer cells.<br><br>

	Title: A Taste of Its Own Medicine: Starving Cancer Cells with Lactate.<br>
	Speaker: George Deng<br>
	When cells become cancerous, they no longer produce energy in the same way as normal cells. Cancer cells consume more glucose to fuel their need to reproduce quickly. A by-product of this shift in metabolism is lactic acid,
	a chemical that normal cells can convert to energy, but cancer cells cannot. By replacing glucose with lactate as the main energy source in cancer cells, they are essentially deprived of their ability to effectively grow and replicate. This study may
	 provide another model for cancer treatment that specifically targets malignant cells without harming healthy ones.<br><br>

	Speaker: Michael Ramada, Stephanie Melendez Ramirez<br>
	We are investigating the effects valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy, can have on various cancer cells lines. VPA has been shown to have positive effects on various tumors as an epigenetic drug, which targets chromatin through
	 inhibition of histone deacetylases and DNA methyl transferases. VPA is in the process of being tested as a chemotherapeutic to influence tumor growth, invasion, and differentiation. When used with other treatments, VPA may have a promising future in the fields
	 of cancer research and treatment.</td>

	One of the proteins that is related to the amyloid build-up in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is c-Abl tyrosine kinase. This same protein is related to several types of cancer. The drug used to treat cancers in which the protein is active is called imatinib mesylate.
	 This drug is used to deactivate the function of c-Abl. The drug used to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's is donepezil hydrochloride. In this study Nabila Ahmed and Meghna Khosla compared the effects of both these drugs on the production of c-Abl within cells<br><br>

	Title: Insulin: The New Brain Food<br>
	Speaker: Amelia Dahl, James Miller<br>
	Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease is an incurable, neurological, degenerative disorder which affects a large portion of the population, particularly older people.
	It is partly caused by a buildup of the A&#946; protein. 
	Insulin growth factor has been shown to increase long-term memory.
	Experiments have demonstrated that a surplus in A&#946; can create a positive feedback loop which causes it to self-propagate.
	The same can be said of insulin as it competes with A&#946; for receptors.
	Our goal is to determine at what concentration the A&#946; protein must reach to create this self-propagating loop.<br><br>

	Title: Plants and Humans: They're More Related Than You Think<br>
	Speaker: Omer Ahmed, Eugene Cai<br>
	Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects dopaminergic cells and it is characterized by difficulties with balance, speech, and motor coordination. Unfortunately, there is much controversy surrounding the issue of where this disease
	 originates. In order to investigate the pathogenesis of PD, the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana is used. Researchers have found that mutations in the human DJ-1 gene, which protects neurons from oxidative stress and cell death, cause PD. Arabidopsis has
	 a homolog of this gene which makes it an ideal choice for studying the oxidative stress response system. Hopefully with further research, the mystery around the mechanisms that lead to PD can be uncovered.<br><br>

	Title: Stop Those Tumors! (with Acetylcholinesterase)<br>
	Speaker: Rachel Chuang, Rafa Rahman<br>
	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme classically associated with neurotransmission, may also increase cell adhesion when coating the surface of a cell. The increase in cell adhesion may induce contact inhibition, thereby decreasing cell proliferation. This
	 experiment studies the effect of coating neuroblastoma cells with acetylcholinesterase on cell proliferation. A decrease in cell proliferation would demonstrate the potential use of AChE as a compound which restricts tumor growth.</td>

	Title: An Innovative Approach to Treating Tuberculosis<br>
	Speaker: Sameer Singh<br>
	Currently, the main treatment for bacterial infections such as Tuberculosis involves the use of antibiotics. However, as more antibiotics are used, bacteria develop resistances to these treatments. Therefore, it is important to investigate more innovative approaches
	 to conquering these bacterial diseases. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a novel treatment solution because bacteria are not able to develop such strong resistances to them. Additionally, their small size and relative potencies, allow these peptides to be effective
	 in a very short period of time. This study explores the potential of these peptides as a possible treatment for Tuberculosis by investigating their potencies. This research has the potential to bring us one step closer to finding a lasting cure for this deadly
	 disease.</td>

	Alcanivorax borkumensis is an oil-consuming bacterium that has been intensively studied since its discovery in 1998.
	The species is found in marine environments and has a unique growth substrate, which consists of an unusually broad range of hydrocarbons found in petroleum.
	Due to its unique metabolic traits, these bacteria can be used as a biological agent in the clean-up process (bioremediation) that takes place after marine oil spills, such as the recent Deepwater Horizon spill.
	Thus it is pertinent that we understand how its unusual metabolic system handles oil. In this study, we will examine some of the key changes in enzymes and proteins that are triggered by different types of hydrocarbons that the bacteria degrade.<br><br>

	Speaker: Ellen Nguyen<br>
	I studied a few short, identifiable DNA sequences called &quot;genetic markers&quot; in a plant called Parthenocissus. Parthenocissus is a plant in the grape family and can be found in in North America as well as parts of Asia. Here, I compared a certain marker
	 called the ITS region to chloroplast results from one or two samples of each Parthenocissus species found in North America.<br><br>

	Title: GRK4 Variants May Contribute to Hypertension via the Adrenomedullin Receptor<br>
	Speaker: Rishav Adhikari<br>
	Although 30% to 50% of hypertension cases are thought to be heritable, the genetic causes have been difficult to determine. Variants of the gene G protein coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) have been widely linked to hypertension. This study investigated the
	 genetic basis of hypertension by determining whether the interaction of variants GRK4 with renal adrenomedullin receptors may contribute to hypertension. By understanding more about GRK4 pathways and the relevant genetic mechanisms of essential hypertension,
	 we may be able to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic treatments.<br><br>

	Title: Fixing a Break or Breaking a Fix? The Role of ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 Related Protein), DNA Polymerase H, and DNA Polymerase I on the Mutational Effect of DNA Repair<br>
	Speaker: Pritha Bhattacharyya<br>
	Ongoing studies in our lab demonstrated that the repair of mismatches at one DNA site can lead to mutations at another site. We used RNA interference methodology to inhibit the expression of the gene for the DNA repair proteins ATR, POLH, and POLI, and examined
	 the effect on the mutational frequency at the supF gene. Our results (for ATR in particular) showed that repairing DNA lesions is self mutagenic at the supF gene, and indicate that distinct repair pathways are involved in the mutational effect of DNA repair,
	 and provide an experimental system to study this important phenomenon.</td>

	Title: Fueling the Future Fires: An Investigation of Biofuel Production through Algal Growth<br>
	Speaker: Chris Groskaufmanis<br>
	It has long been a goal of politicians and scientists alike to find a reliable, renewable fuel resource.
	New and promising research using certain species of algae show that copious amounts of hydrocarbons can be grown in test tubes!

	Title: One Step Closer to an HIV Vaccine?<br>
	Speaker: Jackie Dallaire, Allie Meng<br>
	Every year, over 34 million people are infected by HIV-1 and over 16 million die from this virulent pathogen as the disease progresses to the condition of AIDS. The surface of the virus has thousands of &#8220;spikes,&#8221; which are glycoproteins that allow the virus
	 to enter into host cells. Because conventional means of developing a vaccine have great risk potential, it has been proposed to develop a vaccine of antibodies specific to the spikes on HIV-1, rendering the virus with no means of attachment to host cells.
	 However, before a development of antibodies can be achieved, a thoroughly comprehensive 3D image of the glycoproteins must be constructed. The goal of this project is to develop a method of sub-tomographic averaging that more effectively removes debris or
	 unmatched sub-tomograms when compared to the current method. These sub-tomograms are mistaken by computer programs as glycoproteins, resulting in inaccurate 3D images. The new method can be found by studying the behavior of Euler angle jumps. If successful,
	 theoretically the technique could be applied to any single particle tomography procedure.</td>

	The Effect of Prolonged Exposure of Different Wavelengths of Light on Birth Rate and the Rate of Birth Defects in D. melanogaster.
	We tested for three different types of birth defects, physical, segmental, and chromosomal defects using equipment such as a DNA sequencer and a karyotype photograph.
	Because of the recent relationship found between defects in humans and flies, we hope to find out whether or not prolonged UV exposure can be a cause of birth defects in humans.<br><br>

	Title: Coffee vs. the Cardiac System: The Effects of Caffeine on Cardiac Development in Zebrafish Embryos<br>
	Speaker: Sarah Rachal<br>
	Caffeine is one of the most frequently consumed chemicals in the world.
	Currently, there is no general consensus on whether caffeine is safe for consumption during pregnancy.
	In this experiment, I will study the effects of various levels of caffeine on the cardiac development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
	Caffeine is a known embryotoxin in zebrafish, but it does not have an equally strong impact on human fetuses, which is possibly because caffeine exposure in humans is gradual and not permanent.
	By administering caffeine in low concentrations and for finite periods of time, I hope to replicate the conditions that a human fetus could undergo if its mother consumed caffeine.</td>

	Speaker: Ananya Mishra<br>
	This project explores the interaction that occurs within the human brain and body between neuro-degenerative disease, our immune cells, and antipsychotic drugs. Research has shown that several drugs designed to treat conditions such as schizophrenia,
	 Alzheimers, and Parkinson's disease by altering the way our neurons, or &quot;brain cells&quot; work also have significant effects on immune cells (the cells within our body that help us fight off diseases and infections) throughout our body . Interestingly, antipsychotic
	 drugs actually seem to work against the effects of immune cells. While this weakens our body's protection against bacterial infection, it appears to strengthen our defenses against neurodegenerative disease. Recent research suggests that the repression of
	 immune cell activity within the brain actually protects our neurons and preserves brain function. These effects are also seen in longtime smokers, indicating a pathway that involves the nicotinic receptor. This project explores that pathway.<br><br>

	Title: Characterizing the Developmental Regulation of CASZ1, a Tumor Suppressor in Neuroblastoma<br>
	Speaker: William Nguyen<br>
	Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of the peripheral nervous system, and there are 800 cases per year in the U.S. In neuroblastoma, CASZ1 is a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma. The project looks at the regulation of CASZ1 in the developmental stages to better
	 understand biological mechanism and pathways.<br><br>

	Title: The Telomere as a Tell-All for Severity of Sickle Cell Anemia<br>
	Speaker: Nishant Garg, Shriram Sundararaman<br>
	We are developing a method that could provide doctors a reliable prognostic for sickle cell anemia. This genetic disorder causes the body to manufacture deformed red blood cells that limits the ability to carry oxygen throughout the body. Each year, approximately
	 300,000 newborns are diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. For proper treatment, it is essential for doctors to know the severity of the disease.
	The methods currently available are not reliable predictors of the severity of sickle cell anemia in a patient. We propose a technique that involves measuring the length of telomeres in red blood cells. Telomeres, located on the ends of DNA, are known
	 stress markers and their length varies inversely with stress. With our collective data from patients of The National Children&#8217;s Medical Center, we aim to create a prognostic curve along which doctors can see a correlation between the length of the telomere
	 and the age of the patient, and thus determine the likely severity of the patient&#8217;s disease. In conclusion, the prognosis from this method will allow doctors to initiate appropriate medical care as early as possible.</td>

	Title: Fruit Flies: The Key to Human Immune Solution<br>
	Speaker: Arman Khojandi, Julie Vrabel<br>
	Immune systems are imperative to the survival of all forms of life. An immunological response is initiated once the organism is infected with and recognizes a pathogen. Drosophila melanogaster was the model organism we used in our experiment. The goals of our
	 experiment were to infect multiple strains of flies with various pathogens. Another goal was to analyze the genetic sequences and see which genes were turned on or off to produce specific proteins to fight of said bacteria. Our experiment is pertinent to humans
	 because the immune responses between humans and fruit flies are remarkably similar.<br><br>

	Title: The Effects of Light at Night on Melatonin Concentration and Breast Cancer Risk<br>

	Speaker: Katy Burgio, Allison Wang<br>
	This project will revolve around the goal of making a flowing water remediation system by use of permeable reactive barriers. We are creating a flowing system for a classroom setting and testing methods of groundwater contaminate concentration detection
	 by use of visible spectroscopy and fluorometry. Small-scale test-runs and larger scale systems are being created while using zero-valent iron as the permeable reactive barrier. When the iron PRB is working effectively, we hope to try making a zinc PRB and

	Title: The Development of Methods of Nickel(II) Remediation from Wastewater<br>
	Speaker: Gillie Cuda, Rachel Kumar<br>
	Laboratory wastewater containing nickel(II) must undergo proper treatment to prevent the release of the potentially hazardous nickel(II) into the environment. This study aims to develop a more safe and practical method to remove nickel(II) from wastewater.
	 The most well-established and economical approach is metal remediation through chemical precipitation. This technique involves the conversion of contaminants into insoluble compounds, which are then removed through filtration. Therefore, in this experiment,
	 various chemicals and filtration methods will be tested to determine which one is most effective in precipitating the metal out of solution.<br><br>

	Title: Testing Chemicals That Use Light To Clean Simulated Wastewater<br>
	Speaker: Andrew Hua, Derek Lai, Patrick Yu<br>
	Cleaning wastewater has long been a challenge facing many industries and governments.
	An inexpensive and quick method for remediation is to use chemical reactions to break down harmful substances.
	When dealing with organic compounds or pathogens, a feasible option is titanium dioxide photocatalysis.
	Titanium dioxide, is a semiconductor, which when stimulated by light photons, can create reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide.
	These free radicals break down organic compounds and kill microorganisms.
	The experiment will test the effectiveness at remediation depending on the concentration of titanium dioxide as well as another semiconductor, tin dioxide on various organic compounds.</td>

	Title: Parallel Combinatorial Synthesis of Bioactive Medicinal Compounds Including Peptoid Oligomers<br>
	Speaker: Christopher Rom, Katherine Sheridan, Kerry Zhang<br>
	In the past decade, combinatorial chemistry has changed the modern day approach to drug discovery. The exponential relationship between the number of starting compounds and the number of products, allows researchers to perform fewer reactions and fewer tests
	 than if compounds were synthesized individually. We hope to use this method to synthesize well-known and new antibiotics.<br><br>

	Title: The De-fluoridation of Water Using Natural Methods of Water Remediation<br>
	Speaker: Lucy Shi, Dylan Vu<br>
	In small concentrations, fluoride prevents dental caries. However, just like anything in excess, fluoride can be harmful by weakening bones and causing deformities. This is a major issue in some regions around the world due to naturally high fluoride levels
	 in their water supply. In recent studies, scientists have determined a feasible and efficient way to remove fluoride from water using organic materials. These materials, such as rice and seaweed, are crushed and mixed with concentrated fluoride to yield results.
	 The different biosorbents will be compared for their effectiveness and the intended outcome is to find an inexpensive method for de-fluoridation that can be used around the world. Additionally, ceramic filters will be created using clay and the organic materials.
	 Once heated, the organic materials combust and create perforations in the clay, allowing the pot to act as a filter.</td>

	Speaker: Nancy Wang, Tanmana Sarkar<br>
	Batteries are often disposed of improperly, thus posing a problem for the environment.
	Our project will make the process more inviting by making changes in the process to increase time, cost, and energy efficiency.
	Zinc is an expensive metal and its reserves are quickly decreasing.
	We will focus on recovering zinc by improving a previously established process called hydrometallurgy.
	Factors which we will vary include the solid to liquid ratio of powder to H2SO4, heat, and duration of leaching, and the number of different types of batteries included in the process.<br><br>

	Title: Using Magnetic Composites and Absorbents to Remediate Water<br>
	Speaker: Lian Bloch, Eve Chase<br>
	Throughout the course of this experiment, magnetic composites will be created. The composites will include activated carbon which has absorbent properties, in order to remove dissolved compounds within the water. A magnet will be used to attract the composites
	 while the water is poured out. In order to determine the effectiveness of the composites on two different water remediation situations, oil spills and heavy metal ions, a UV-Vis spectrometer will be used to determine the concentration of the contaminants before
	 and after treatment with the composites.</td>

	Speaker: Daniel Kang, Alexander Yang<br>
	We plan on observing the durability of conductive polymers over time under variable temperatures. In this study, we will synthesize polypyrrole film and observe the conductivity under various temperatures over time. At the conclusion of the four-month experimentation,
	 we expect the conductivity for every film to decrease, with the heated films conducting more than the cooler films.<br><br>

	Title: Mean Green Nano Machines: Synthesis and Comparison of Quantum Dot Solar Cells<br>
	Speaker: Connie Scoggins, Ellen Howerton<br>
	Quantum dot (QD) solar cells are a leading breakthrough in solar energy technology. QDs, or engineered nanoparticles, have adjustable bandgaps that can be &#8220;tuned&#8221; to absorb certain wavelengths of light, including UV rays. QDs can therefore absorb more radiation,
	 increasing the energy output of a solar cell. In this experiment, four types of QDs were synthesized and analyzed. Solar cells were constructed to measure the energy output of the cells, with the goal of determining which type of QDs
	 is most suited for solar cell use.</td>

	In this experiment, BPA is separated from varying samples of water from bottles put under stressed conditions.
	The compound is then collected and concentrated with a reverse solid phase extraction.
	The compound is then further concentrated by passing through nitrogen gas.
	Then, the sample is put through the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer takes the reading of just how much sample there is.

	Title: Synthesis of Fluorescent Surface-Passivated Carbon Dots (CDs)<br>
	Speaker: Aki Gao<br>
	Fluorescent nanostructures are a relatively recent class of compounds that are gaining prominence in optoelectronics, bioimaging and drug therapy. Among these nanostructures, Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive alternatives to conventional fluorescent dyes for
	 biological applications due to their superior optical intensity, range of wavelength emissions and resistance to emission attenuation due to photobleaching. However, commercially available QDs comprise of cadmium, and other restricted heavy metals, and as
	 a consequence, pose concerns for biological applications. Thus, it necessary to explore alternatives with comparable efficacy. Carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene and nanodiamonds are among the many new nanostructures
	 currently gaining popularity in the field of nanotechnology, but a particularly attractive carbon particle is carbon dots (CDs). CDs are nanomolecules of carbon surface-passivated by organic polymers, which allow CDs to fluoresce under visible and near-infrared
	 (NIR) excitation sources. CDs exhibit comparable emission yields to Quantum dots (QDs) and their optical performance are competitive with them as well. Furthermore, CDs have demonstrated greater biocompatibility than QDs and thus, more research is necessary
	 in order for these promising nanomolecules to reach their full potentiality.<br><br>

	Title: Protein Detection by Gold Nanoparticle Complexes<br>
	Speaker: Varun Kumar, Eashan Kaw<br>

	 of the gold nanoparticles made under each method will be compared along with the protein binding affinity (measured by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy) of particles synthesized by each method. Due to covalent interactions in the Turkevich method, it will
	 have the greater binding affinity to proteins.</td>

	Title: Quantification of Al/Si Ratios in Aluminosilicate Nanoparticles<br>
	Speaker: Eric Li<br>
	This project will test the application of aluminosilicate nanoparticles to improving the overall performance of concrete. The plan is to create a wide range of aluminosilicate nanoparticles or sol gels to observe. These gels are all engineered differently with
	 certain methods to be considered. These methods vary when creating these gels in the amount hydration, alumina ratio, type of alcohol, and type of acids used to create these gels. These variables will ultimately affect the structure and therefore the performance
	 of concrete. The main focus of the project, however, is to concentrate on the aluminosilicate ratios and their subsequent effect on bonding and structure of the gel and how it can improve physical properties of concrete. The samples mixed will be mostly analyzed
	 through FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) techniques but also analyzed through x-ray florescence.
	The samples will be applied to concrete to test tensile strengths and physical properties for a real world application to the improvements to concrete in roads, bridges, and buildings.<br><br>

	Title: Copper Filter Development for Water Remediation Using Banana Peel<br>
	Speaker: Sara Asad, Elaine Chen<br>
	This study investigates the extraction of Cu(II) ions from banana peel in aqueous solutions of different pH. The banana peel was prepared by increasing the maximum surface area of the material through pulverization and higher metal ion retention through acid
	 and base treatment. The procedure used in the laboratory was applied to the local stream water (Sugarland Run Stream) to assess the impact of heavy metal extraction on raw solution sample. Results indicate significant copper ion extraction
	 by banana peel treated in pH 3 and 30&deg;C solution. Although the likelihood of other substances fluidly binding metal ions in solution was higher in the raw water sample, the difference between preconcentration and final concentration of metal ions was significant.<br><br>

	 methanol will be measured at a 515 (or 490) nm. The absorbance should decrease when the radical is reduced by antioxidants. The best radical scavenging ability of the antioxidants contained in ascorbic acid, &#945;-tocopherol,pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin,
	 acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen will be determined by how fast the absorbance decreases.</td>

	Title: Efficiency Analysis of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells<br>
	Speaker: Chantelle Ekanem, Kwan Lee<br>
	Dye-sensitized solar cells are currently cheap potential alternative energy sources that utilize dye and photo electrochemical components to convert light into energy. Their current peak power production efficiency is about 11.1% which is what we want to improve.
	 Through altering factors such as dye components, the efficiency could be improved. We will analyze their performance through electrochemical analysis methods and also compare dyes using visual spectroscopy.<br><br>

	Title: Colloidal Synthesis of Quantum Dots for Use in Photovoltaic Cells<br>
	Speaker: Bradley Hodge, Jahnnavi Madiraju<br>
	This proposal details the possibility of synthesizing non-toxic quantum dots of various sizes for use in a photovoltaic (solar) cell.
	The dots will be synthesized using a colloidal synthesis method, and we will analyze the dots using UV/Vis Spectrometry of the quantum dots in solution. The absorption and emission spectra will be analyzed to determine the dots&#8217; viability for use in
	 a solar cell, though they will not be tested for such. We hope to determine the safest, most efficient species of dot for use in a cell.
	The process of synthesis and analysis will be documented for future use in the lab.</td>

	Title: Are crossbalks, stoplates, and traffic dams and deplores wasting your time? There's always the EVIL way...<br>
	Speaker: Alexander De Anda, Alice Ju<br>
	In all developed parts of the world, human error in transportation results in inefficiency, pollution, injury, and frustration to all who share the road. This problem causes millions of deaths and dollars in debt per year, so any logical conclusion would require
	 a new, faster, safer method of transportation. For the purpose of designing and creating a form of transit to better both economy and environment, the Economically Viable Individualized Lanecar was proposed, and is hereby evaluated.<br><br>

	Title: An Enclosed, Weatherproof Speedway for Low-Emissions Racing<br>
	Speaker: Zachary Williams<br>
	Auto racing, more than almost any commercially significant sport, finds itself at the mercy of the weather when it comes to holding its competitions.
	For example, regulatory bodies such as NASCAR do not permit racing to take place in rain or any other precipitation, and racing is much less appealing to exposed fans in poor weather.
	Other traditionally outdoor sporting events, such as football and baseball, are increasingly taking place in stadiums that are either indoors or have retractable roofs.
	Auto racing, however, doesn&#8217;t have that luxury because of its emissions, which are toxic in an enclosed environment, and the sheer size of race tracks.
	As automotive technology improves, cars will have lower emissions, and possibly zero toxic emissions eventually. With these reduced emissions, an enclosed racetrack would become feasible. This project demonstrates the possibility of an enclosed short
	 speedway in years to come.</td>

	Speaker: Christine Harris, Stacey Zhou<br>
	By the year 2050, the world's population will have increased to 9.1 billion people. In order to feed this enlarged population by conventional agricultural means, it would be necessary to increase agricultural production by around 70%. Population scientists
	 predict that unless new, more efficient and environmentally sustainable types of farming are introduced, farmers will need over 8.5 million square kilometers of arable farmland to feed the rapidly growing population. A number of solutions to this problem have
	 been suggested, and one of the most promising is the idea of creating multistory greenhouses, or vertical farms. In our talk, we will share our innovative vertical farm, and discuss how this design will allow for cost-effectiveness and year-long crop production.

	Speaker: Daniel Jacobson<br>
	While some animals migrate by instinct, many others are driven circumstance:
	climate change, habitat destruction, or other stress factors. The actions of individuals in these migrating groups can be modeled as a combination of two factors: personal survival instinct and social conformism. By modeling the overall migratory behavior
	 of a group as determined by individual decisions, and then allowing these behavioral patterns to evolve over time,
	this project will provide new insights into how individuals in a species interact to maximize group survival.<br><br>

	Title: Translating A Zombie Language Using Rule-Based Means<br>
	Speaker: Daphne Fong<br>
	As of now, there isn't an existing Latin translator that functions with any sort of accuracy. My project tries to produce a Latin translator that translates from Latin prose to English with relatively more accuracy than the current leading translator (Google
	 Translate). Google uses a form of statistical machine translation (SMT), which isn't optimal for translating Latin because Latin simply doesn't have enough preexisting examples in order to generate statistically significant patterns. By using rule-based machine
	 translation (RMT) instead, I hope to have a more accurate translator.</td>

	Title: A Search Engine with Content-Based Data Retrieval<br>
	Speaker: Alex Chen<br>
	Search engines nowadays are able to retrieve data from a multitude of domains, including text, images, music, and audio. To implement this, a search engine will typically employ one type of data as a means of indexing. For example, many search engines search
	 for data primarily using text-based tags. However, many times these tags are misleading. When searching for obscure topics, they often return irrelevant images while skipping relevant ones. This project aims to avoid this problem with a multi-domain search

	Speaker: Helen Hastings<br>
	Gaussian noise can be used to disrupt signals. However, as noise is added to a binary channel, it is possible that the noise will enhance the capacity.
	This phenomenon is called stochastic resonance. By testing various conditions of the channels and different distributions of Gaussian noise, an optimum amount of noise to provide maximum stochastic resonance can be found using derived formulas to calculate
	 capacity and a theoretical computer simulation to test the variables.<br><br>

	Speaker: Max Miroff<br>
	While they do not directly emit harmful exhaust, EVs are nevertheless powered overwhelmingly by the energy generated in coal power plants. The implementation of a fully &quot;green&quot; infrastructure would mean that a new energy source for electric cars would
	 have to be found. One possibility is to have power completely supplied from the users homes, which would be powered by sources such as solar and wind. This necessitates
	<br>
	the development of a charging interface between a car and a renewable home. It is also necessary to investigate how electric vehicles could be integrated into a fully renewable energy infrastructure, which requires modeling based on vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology.
	 Recent studies have investigated the viability of using an EV fleet powered by wholly renewable resources. An especially relevant potential market for this is Denmark, which draws a large source of its power from wind energy, but in the future it is expected
	 that electric vehicle fleets will become major players in a non-fossil fuel transportation market in many countries. Wide-scale tests of EV fleet viability are being attempted in Israel, the United States, and other countries, making this research contemporary
	 and relevant. <br><br>

	Speaker: Thomas Tapen<br>
	I am building a Class D or switching audio amplifier designed to play music. Class D amplifiers differ from traditional amplifier topologies in their power efficiency. Conventional amplifiers are usually no better than 50% efficient. In other words, at
	 most half of the power the circuit draws does not become sound. My goal is to create an amplifier in which at least 80% of the power it draws becomes sound energy.<br><br>

	Title: Designing an FPGA-based Delay-and-Sum Microphone Array Beamformer<br>
	Speaker: Edward Danyliw<br>
	A microphone array beamformer is a technology that can selectively listen only to sounds coming from certain directions. This has applications in speech recognition and processing, recording, and teleconferencing. This project uses an FPGA (Field Programmable
	 Gate Array) to handle the processing because it can listen to several beams simultaneously and operate in real-time. I look at the design considerations that go into designing a beamformer and will outline guidelines that should be followed by other designers.<br><br>

	Title: SpideySense: Better Touch Sensing<br>
	Speaker: Nick Arango, Gabriel Boning<br>
	Multitouch surfaces are commonplace but are either inaccurate, small, or expensive. We hope to change this with a cheap, scalable, and accurate technology we are calling Spideysense. SpideySense has a modular design, enabling scalability, is highly accurate,
	 and has a low cost by using off the self components with no need for special materials.</td>

	Speaker: Peter Town<br>
	In recent years, a new type of security vulnerability has come to light. Although many organizations and individuals use hard drive encryption to protect against malevolent parties with physical access to their computers, researchers have discovered that
	 temporary memory (RAM) is also vulnerable. I have investigated encryption of the RAM medium to protect against these attacks.<br><br>

	Title: How to Amplify Music More Efficiently<br>
	Speaker: Stephen Weischedel<br>
	I will discuss the issues faced in increasing the effiency of an audio power amplifier (an amp for powering speakers), and my experiences in designing and constructing a Class D amp, a recent innovation in audio amplifier technology.<br><br>

	Title: Follow the Light! Developing an underwater pacing system for lap swimmers.<br>
	Speaker: Andrew Martin<br>
	The ultimate design goal is to develop a strip of LEDs that are flashed in series forwards and backwards down the lenght of a pool. A person swimming freestyle can monitor the position of the lit LED in the strip to see if they are meeting their pacing goal.
	 While initial designs will have only one or two speed settings for the LED, the ultimate design goal is to make the speed completely variable.</td>

	Speaker: Angela Liu, Caroline Woods<br>
	When cockroaches are stung by their predator, the wasp, they fall into a hypnotic state where they can&#8217;t fight or flee.
	Instead they start grooming themselves excessively. 
	This gives the wasp time to drag the cockroach into its den and lay eggs on the cockroach.
	When the eggs hatch, the baby wasps eat the cockroach from the inside out. So why do these cockroaches fall into this state?
	Previous research has shown that when the cockroaches are stung, a certain neurotransmitter, octopamine, is blocked.
	Our experiment tests the cockroach&#8217;s system under conditions of octopamine and an octopamine antagonist.
	Come to our talk to find out how the cockroach responds!<br><br>

	Title: Deep Scan: Making Medical Imaging Easy<br>
	Speaker: Connor Brinton, Flint Song<br>
	Medical Imaging (MI) technology is rapidly advancing. In fact, MI tech is progressing so quickly, that we don't know how to use it properly. Using advanced image analysis techniques and computerized guess-and-check, we have created a tool that allows researchers
	 to calibrate a MI machine with just one click.<br><br>

	Title: Swimming and Schizophrenia<br>
	Speaker: Skyler Anderson, Callan Corcoran<br>
	Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is implicated in many neurological disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. Serotonin is also central to signaling in the leech nervous system. With an artificial stimulus, leeches can be prompted to produce sinusoidal
	 swimming signals. We hope to examine the effects of varied serotonin levels on this rhythmic swimming activity in leeches. Our data may bring to light new information about the qualities of serotonin&#8212;information which may eventually contribute to research
	 on neurological disorders in humans.<br><br>

	Title: Shocking Sea Slugs on Drugs<br>
	Speaker: Sruthi Poduval, Mashal Wakilpoor <br>
	When we are shocked by static electricity, our reflex is to flinch away from the source. In an Aplysia californica, a sea slug, the siphon is the part that reacts to any threats, including electricity. Our project looks at the siphon withdrawal reflex and the
	 habituation it goes through after being shocked multiple times, and later, the effects of the ganglion being drugged on the siphon habituation.</td>

	Speaker: Andrew Kim, Ryan Yan<br>
	Eugenol is naturally occuring in plant essential oils such as clove oil. It acts as an octopamine antagonist, and as such disrupts motor function in insects. To test the efficacy of eugenol in a pesticide, we tested its effects on the amplitude of nerve
	 signals along the ventral nerve cord of the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach.<br><br>

	Title: Nerves Ripped? Not a problem, We can grow new ones!<br>
	Speaker: Gayatri Sardana, Heather Storeide<br>
	The purpose of our experiment is to observe and monitor nerve regeneration in leeches using an Optical Coherence Tomography unit (OCT). We dissect leeches so we can see the nerves and then pinch them before placing them under the OCT. Using the machine, we
	 can see what is happening to the nerve over time. After this process, we suture the leech back together and place it in the swim tank to watch it attempt to regain its ability to swim.
	We can apply our findings to human neurodegenerative diseases to see if a similar phenomenon can be found in humans.<br><br>

	Title: Drugging Sluggish Slugs to Observe Habituation<br>
	Speaker: Serena Lei, Elizabeth Nguyen<br>
	A response of Aplysia california, a type of sea slug, to possible harmful stimuli is the gill-siphon withdrawal (GSW) reflex. Contraction of the siphon protects the gill from danger. In our experiment, we shock the Aplysia using electricity to observe the habituation
	 of this reflex with continued exposure to the stimulus. Our study aims to observe habituation when a specific chemical is added, possibly blocking a critical protein involved in the process.<br><br>

	Title: Role Reversal: The effect of serotonin on inversion of social dominance status in Procambarus clarkii<br>
	Speaker: Sarah Sam, Suganya Sridharma<br>
	Juvenile crayfish fight immediately upon pairing to establish a dominance heirarchy. We predict that artificially raising the serotonin level of the subordinate in a pair of crayfish that have undergone facial modification will result in a reversal of the established
	 dominance. By understanding the role of serotonin in establishment of social dominance status, future experiments can be done to further understand the serotonergic system in regards to its depression modulation.<br><br>

	Speaker: Katherine Yu<br>
	&#945;-Synuclein is a protein that, when misfolded or mutated, causes neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease.
	The protein, as well as the disease, is largely unknown in function and characterization, so I tried to better understand this vital protein.
	Particularly when misfolded, the protein gains toxic functions, so I misfolded and studied four synuclein proteins in this project.<br><br>

	Title: Optogenetic Dissection of Somatosensory Neuron Function<br>
	Speaker: Rithvik Prasannappa<br>
	I developed a novel assay to dissect the function of somatosensory neurons using optogenetic techniques. My research links the behavioral function of class III neurons to cold thermosensation.<br><br>

	Title: Colocalization of GPRIN1 and Nicotinic Receptors in the Developing and Adult Brain
	<br>
	Speaker: Snigdha Kumar<br>
	The expression of G-protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) stimulates neurite extension and leads to its accumulation in growth cones.
	Additionally, the interaction between GPRIN1 and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs) in neurons has been implicated as a key component in the pathway regulating neuronal differentiation and axonal growth.
	To test for colocalization of nAChRs and GPRIN1 proteins in the developing brain, brain tissue from mice was stained using antibodies selective for GPRIN1 and the alpha 7 nAChR. We examined the colocalization of the two proteins in neural compartment
	 of brain regions as the hippocampus, cortex, and the thalamic nuclei via confocal microscopy.
	Our findings support the theory that interactions between GPRIN1 and nAChRs play a role in synaptic functions in various brain regions.</td>

	Speaker: Avi Mehta, Aravind Ponukumati<br>
	For the project, cockroaches will be dissected in search of their major nerve, the ventral nerve. Once this nerve is found, it will be exposed to different chemicals that will hypersensitize it or desensitize it. It will make the movement area more active
	 or less active. This will be tested by seeing the change in signals and seeing if any signals pass through the nerve cord after it cockroach is exposed to these chemicals.<br><br>

	Title: Put on Your Thinking Cap: A Mind-Controlled Wheelchair<br>
	Speaker: Connor Hann, Bina Kakusa, Marvin Qian<br>
	A &#8220;mind-controlled&#8221; wheelchair has enormous applications, especially for those who have some form of paralysis. The wheelchair my partner and I have helped create is controlled solely by thoughts. This is done using electroencephalography (EEG), which measures
	 electrical signals generated by the brain. These EEG signals are analyzed by a computer program which then sends commands to the electronic wheelchair. The chair currently is capable of moving in only two directions, but we are currently working to expand
	 this to four directions so the user will have a full range of motion.<br><br>

	Title: Can Color Give Crayfish a Home-field Advantage?<br>
	Speaker: Gina Hansen, Cassandra Leong<br>
	What colors can a crayfish consciously see? We studied the psychological effects of changing the color of a crayfish&#8217;s visual environment.
	Crayfish naturally fight for dominance in a social hierarchy, so we habituated one crayfish in a red-colored home, and another in blue.
	When these two were placed in a single tank-- colored red, for example--, we expected the crayfish habituated to red to establish dominance.<br><br>

	Title: Intracellular recording of signals from Aplysia californica ganglial cells<br>
	Speaker: Laura Minnema, Jacqueline Tran<br>

	Speaker: Akhil Kolluri, Jonathan Youssef<br>
	Crayfish are freshwater crustaceans whose signature tail-flip, which represents the most basic of reflexes, is caused by nerve impulses that can be translated into electrical signals. We isolated two crayfish, one in a green tank and the other in an orange
	 tank, every Wednesday and Friday. After a week of isolation, we fought the crayfish in a tank of either color and analyzed their aggressiveness as well as possible correlations towards the colors of their isolation tanks.<br><br>

	Title: Just Keep Swimming: The Effect of Serotonin on the Swimming Behavior of Hirudo medicinalis<br>
	Speaker: Chinmayee Balabhadrapatruni, Alexander Zaita<br>
	The neurotransmitter serotonin plays an important role in many behavioral functions. In this study we observe how this neurotransmitter influences the swimming patterns of medicinal leeches. The leech is a great model for neuroscience research because of its
	 simplicity, with only 400 identifiable neurons in the segmental ganglia. Past studies indicate that serotonin can induce episodic swimming behavior by stimulating the neurons in the leech.<br><br>

	Title: Habituation: Don't Get Used to It!<br>
	Speaker: Emilie Fortman, Emily Ji<br>
	If a neuron is repeatedly stimulated, then the response will decrease with time.
	This phenomenon is called habituation. The goal of our project is to see if serotonin will reverse the effects of habituation in Aplysia californica.</td>

	Speaker: Brendan Kim, Jane Pak<br>
	Using two different mixtures of seawater, crude oil, and oil eating bacteria we will observe the effects of mixing these samples in varying concentrations. The first sample contains a chemical dispersant, COREXIT EC9500A, which appears to make the bacteria
	 digest only long-chain hydrocarbons. Conversely, the sample without COREXIT appears to digest only the short-length hydrocarbons. By mixing these two samples we hope to obtain a mixture that utilizes the digestive properties of both samples and most effectively
	 consume all varieties of hydrocarbons.<br><br>

	Title: The Intelligence of a Sleep-Deprived Octopus<br>
	Speaker: Adrienne Gillevet, Lucia Liu<br>
	Octopuses are unique among invertebrates for their intelligence. Research has long shown that they are quite capable of learning to simple tasks, such as navigating under water mazes or choosing between two similar objects. And of course - as the students of
	 TJ know - sleep is important to learning and memory retention. We investigated whether having no sleep affect the abilities of our octopuses. This could provide a key clue as to exactly how complex these cephalopods are. Come stop by and see the Octopuses
	 perform tricks!<br><br>

	Title: A Novel Real-Time Flood Warning System for the United States via Mobile and Web Based Application<br>
	Speaker: Darwin Li<br>
	In my study, I had two objectives. First, to perform percentile analysis on the various real-time flooding factor values against historical data, and quantify the error to model and effectively determine the flooding risk of the area around USGS stream gauge
	 stations across the nation. The second is to use the developed model and various programming languages to create a user-friendly application compatible with computer and phone that allows a user to view the flooding rating and relevant flooding risk information
	at any location by simply entering a city name and state, or zip-code.</td>

	Speaker: Rebecca Edelstein, Melody Liu<br>
	The objective of the experiment is to determine the effect of increasing temperature on the locomotor activity of juvenile horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus. This information will give insight into the behavior of juvenile horseshoe crabs, as well predict
	 ramifications of climate change on general movement and migratory breeding patterns.<br><br>

	Title: The Truth Will Set You Free: Groundtruthing Side Scan Sonar Images<br>
	Speaker: Anita Shammee, Shannon Smith<br>
	Oyster populations in the Chesapeake Bay have been reduced to one percent of their historic numbers. Restoration efforts are aimed at improving current oyster population levels by using side scan sonar images as a baseline map of potential restoration sites.
	 The focus of our project was to groundtruth the acoustic data with video footage to obtain a better understanding of where oysters are most likely to succeed at forming new reefs.<br><br>

	Title: A New Algorithm for Waste Load Allocation<br>
	Speaker: Cindy Zou<br>
	The project involves the incorporation of a bound-expansion based nonlinearity interface mapping system (NIMS) for nonlinear waste load allocation simulation-optimization. To minimize inherent uncertainties, a risk-explicit interval linear programming (REILP)
	 approach is also undertaken. With a computational efficiency much greater than that of traditionally-utilized genetic algorithms, the bound-expansion based NIMS could save the government and the private sector time and billions in spending.</td>

	Speaker: James Graham, Elizabeth Steele<br>
	A survey and analysis of techniques in using Atomic Force Microscopy with samples we have prepared. This presentation discusses what using these methods with the Nanosurf 2 easyScan Atomic Force Microscope reveals about the samples.<br><br>

	Title: Chip-Scale Microscopy with Micro-Lens Arrays for Localized Super-Resolution<br>
	Speaker: Pranava Raparla<br>
	The modern light microscope, consisting of expensive lens objectives and a large frame, is an essential tool in the laboratory for simple and fast analysis of a specimen. However, the cost and size of these microscopes render field use impractical. The novel
	 chip-scale microscope method and prototype designed and fabricated in this investigation combine the use of micro-lens arrays in multi-aperture configurations with an image processing technique known as, &#8220;Super-resolution.&#8221;<br><br>

	Title: A Sound Alternative to 3D Imaging<br>
	Speaker: Akhila Ananthram, James Bradbury, Matt Callahan, Hayden Chun, Ashley Jhu, Zeming Lin, Stefanie van Rafelghem<br>
	The product of our year-long project is an omnidirectional sonar system analogous to a bat&#8217;s sonar. The apparatus sends out a sound signal, which bounces off surfaces and returns to the microphones in our array. The sound signals are then processed by our software
	 and used to generate a three-dimensional image of the surrounding area.</td>

	Speaker: William Rieger<br>
	The primary objective of my project is to determine how much processing power is needed to display 3D content on a holographic display in real-time. More specifically, I wish to see if a typical desktop computer or laptop is able to do so. This involves studying
	 and comparing various algorithms used to calculate digital holographic data.<br><br>

	Title: Making Metamaterials<br>
	Speaker: Vansh Kumar<br>
	The goal of this project is to make metamaterials. Metamaterials, also known as left-handed materials, are combinations of different materials in a specific way to produce certain properties. Metamaterials are most commonly known for having a negative refractive
	 index. The first task is to create a single metamaterial, reproducing the results of an experiment detailed in a paper. We will extend the experiment to include a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), which can analyze waves in great detail,
	 giving their amplitude, phase, and other pertinent information. We will then test
	using conductive inks and a stencil to create these metamaterials.<br><br>

	Title: Angry Beads: Shocking Developments in an Electromechanical Self-Organizing System<br>
	Speaker: Kristina Hu, Samuel Luo, Victor Shao, Elliot Simon, Mihir Srivastava<br>
	A hundred tiny beads are placed in the center of a petri dish and covered in castor oil. We induce a radial electric field by creating a potential difference between the center and the edge of the dish. You might expect the beads to simply drift linearly toward
	 the edge. Surprisingly, this is not the case&#8212;the beads form organized, branching patterns. What makes them do this? Our group researched the forces at work and worked on a quantitative model to predict the end positions resulting from different bead starting
	 locations. These self-organizing systems have applications in fields like physics, biology, neuroscience, and computer science.</td>

	Speaker: Aedan Collins, Mary Kate Dilworth, Andrew Martin<br>
	The ultimate design goal is to develop a strip of LEDs that are flashed in series forwards and backwards down the lenght of a pool. A person swimming freestyle can monitor the position of the lit LED in the strip to see if they are meeting their pacing goal.
	 While initial designs will have only one or two speed settings for the LED, the ultimate design goal is to make the speed completely variable.

	Title: Movement in Space Using Gyroscopes<br>
	Speaker: Alex Napier, Srishti Shrivastava <br>
	Traditional robots have always relied on rotation using motor-driven wheels, fins, and propellers. However, in low friction or near-vacuum environments, these methods are infeasible- underwater, or in space. This problem can be solved using gyroscope-driven
	 rotation. We will be presenting a simple Control Moment Gyroscope, a mechanism designed to tackle this problem.
	This presentation will discuss the theory and implications of gyroscopic motion.<br><br>

	Title: Driving Fast with the Use of an Electric Vehicle<br>
	Speaker: Matt Bujor, Robbie Clark, Victor Weiss<br>
	We are researching, constructing, and testing an electric vehicle. It is a scale model of a passenger car, and it fits a driver and one other person. 35 mph is the goal for its maximum speed. Before it can be driven, however, all systems such as brakes, steering,
	 motors, suspension, and framework/safety must be fully functional</td>

	Speaker: Austin Donohue, Michael Poussard<br>
	We tested different airfoil designs in order to build an airfoil optimized for maximum critical angle of attack, or the angle at which a wing ceases to produce lift, and therefore maneuverability. In dogfights and other situation where maneuverability
	 is key, this airfoil should allow for increased performance and better results.<br><br>

	Title: Floating on Air Over Land and Water<br>
	Speaker: Ben Rosenblum<br>
	I am designing and building a hovercraft. A hovercraft does not &quot;fly&quot;, but rather slides with low friction on the ground. The craft will have two engines, one for the creation of an air cushion and one for the propulsion. It should be able to travel both over
	 land and over water due to the air cushion.<br><br>

	Title: And They All Fell Down...Looking at a System to Absorb Earthquake Vibrations<br>
	Speaker: Elisabeth von Spakovsky<br>
	Virginia&#8217;s earthquake over the summer was an anomaly, but it caused a lot of damage to buildings.
	I experimented with a system to attach to already existing homes, in order to absorb the vibration from earthquakes and minimize structural damage.
	Current earthquake engineering is expensive, and difficult to retrofit.
	If a simpler, cheaper system could be found, it could be attached to buildings to minimize damage in future earthquakes.</td>

	Come watch as we demonstrate our self-balancing vehicle, modeled roughly on the Segway. Made with a body similar to a skateboard, though two-wheeled, it response to the rider's shifting weight to move in the intended direction. We will also discuss the
	 practical applications of such a vehicle.<br><br>

	Title: Skywalker Hand<br>
	Speaker: Tien Bui<br>
	For my project, I designed and developed a prosthetic hand for amputees. Five servos enable each finger to move on its own as well as grip items with precision. When attached to an electroencephalogram (EEG) machine, the prosthetic device enables the amputee
	 to control his fingers with merely a thought. This prosthetic hand has plenty of applications in the real world, allowing patients with missing limbs to perform daily tasks with ease.<br><br>

	Title: Design and Implementation of a Single Engine Hovercraft<br>
	Speaker: William Johnston<br>
	My presentation will start with a PowerPoint presentation about hovercrafts and the design process of my hovercraft. I will then demonstrate the hovercraft in use, and have everyone go outside, where I will fire it up and drive it around. I might even let the
	 audience members have a go!<br><br>

	Title: Creation of a Device that Efficiently Collects Tennis Balls<br>
	Speaker: Govind Mattay<br>
	During tennis practices, tennis balls can clutter the court and are a pain to pick up. The goal of my project is to create a mechanism capable of quickly clearing tennis courts. Though current technology to collect tennis balls exists, the device that I am
	 designing aims to be automated, portable, cheap, and efficient. The most viable option to fulfill these requirements is a four-wheeled robot that drives around the court in a preset pattern while employing a collection mechanism. This investigation is fascinating
	 because it applies simple robotics to solve a real world problem. Furthermore, if this design is successful, it could radically improve tennis practices and matches.</td>
