  Internet Set-Up for Using TJHSST Library
  <br />Online Databases From Home
</h1>

<h2><strong>A full PDF pictorial guide to configuring your TJHSST Database access is available at <a href="[<$I2_ROOT>]www/info/dbproxy.pdf">this link</a>.</strong></h2>
<p>Another helpful set of instructions created by library staff is provided at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tjproxyaccess/">https://sites.google.com/site/tjproxyaccess/</a>.</p>
<p>
Our library subscribes to online databases with high quality, authoritative resources that are
essential for your high school research. On campus, they open automatically because the
database providers can tell the search is coming from a school that has paid for the service.
The databases can also be accessed from home. But students need to set up their browser
(for example Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) to connect to our school's server so that the
databases "think" you are actually on campus when you go to those database sites. This is
called "configuring your proxy settings" and it's easy to reconfigure your internet browser to link to
the databases via our TJ server.
</p>

<p>To setup your database proxy settings, please see the guide linked above. If you are having trouble with the database proxy, please email <a href="mailto:dbproxy@tjhsst.edu">dbproxy@tjhsst.edu</a>.
Be sure to include your username, the operating system and browser (including version if possible) that you are using, and the database that you are trying to access.</p>

<p>You can access the databases at the Library's <a href="[<$dbsite>]">Online Databases</a> web page. You will need to go to 
   <a href="[<$dbsite>]">[<$dbsite>]</a>.</p>
