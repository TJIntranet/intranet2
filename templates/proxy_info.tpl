  Internet Set-Up for Using TJHSST Library
  <br />Online Databases From Home
</h1>

<p>By virtue of a proxy/authentication process that uses your Novell account
   on the TJ school LAN, you can now access from home a variety of resources
   at TJ. Currently, our library subscribes to online databases that are
   available for research from school and home. Note too, that students
   are running a student-based Intranet that is accessed off the 
   <a href="http://www.tjhsst.edu/">TJ Home Page.</a>
</p>
<p>
   Access to these resources is accomplished by configuring the proxy settings 
   on your browser according the step by step directions below.
</p>
         
<p>In order to reach the library's
   <a href="http://www.tjhsst.edu/%7Elibrary/database.htm">Online Databases</a>
   you will need to point your Internet Explorer browser to
   <a href="http://www.tjhsst.edu/%7Elibrary/database.htm">
   http://www.tjhsst.edu/~library/database.htm</a>,
   where you will find links to these resources. These directions 
   may  vary slightly according to the version you are using, but should apply 
   to  both PC and Macintosh platforms. As Fairfax County revises access 
   rules  and applications, there will be some variations in the screens you 
   see.
