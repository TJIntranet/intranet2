    <h1>Eighth Period Policies 2014-2015</h1>
    <h2>Eighth Period Signups:</h2>
    <h3>I understand that:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>All students must sign up for 8th period by the end of lunch</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Any student who has not signed up by lunch will be scheduled into an Administrative Study Hall</b> staffed 
            by an available teacher. This is not detention. Students may check the intranet or the roster posted outside the 
            8th period office for the location (no pass needed).
            <i>Students may not change from that activity for any reason. Any absence from these study halls will not be cleared.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Any student whose activity is cancelled</b> must sign up for another activity before the end of lunch or come to 
            the 8th period office for a pass to any other activity that is not full. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Any student who has signed up and wishes to change their activity after lunch</b> (except those in a sticky) 
            must come get a pass to another academic activity that is not full.
        </li>
        <li>
            There will be some circumstances where a student does not know by 12:30 that they need to meet with a 
            teacher. In those <i>rare</i> cases, your teacher should communicate directly with the 8th period office.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eighth Period Attendance:</h2>
    <h3>I understand that:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Because 8th period is a required part of the school day, the school must account for the whereabouts of each
            student during this time.
            <b>Attendance is recorded for each activity.</b>
            NOTE: <i>Counselors and teachers may
            use 8th period attendance as one measure of responsibility and reliability when considering students for
            leadership positions, mentorships, or in preparing college recommendations. Student parking spaces are
            allocated only after a review of 8th period attendance records.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Students must keep track of their attendance and that absences must be cleared within two 
            weeks.</b> The number of unexcused 8th period absences will be displayed in RED at the top of the 8th Period 
            interface. If a student's absences are not cleared, they may be referred to the grade level administrator for 
            placement in Administrative Detention.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Administrative Detention:</h2>
    <h3>I understand that:</h3>
    <p>
        Administrative Detention is a double block activity for students with unexcused 8th period absences. 
        Following the criteria below, students will be assigned to Administrative Detention during 8th period. 
        Students will receive an email letting them know and giving them a deadline to fix any mistakes with their
        teacher(s). If the absences are not cleared in time, the student will be assigned to a double block of 
        Detention. Students may not be excused from Detention for any reason. Failure to show up for the whole 
        period will result in a referral to the grade level administrator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assignment to detention is based upon attendance EACH quarter. However, <i>absences are recorded for 
        the year and DO NOT disappear after attending Administrative Detention</i>. Yearly totals are used for 
        referrals (as outlined below), assigning leadership, mentorship, parking and other privileges. 
    </p>
    <h3>Administrative Detention is on a per quarter basis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>If a student gets 2 or more absences in any quarter</b>, they will be assigned to 
        Administrative Detention.</li>
        <li><b>If a student gets any additional absences</b> in the SAME quarter after attending AD that 
        quarter, they will be assigned to the next Administrative Detention.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Students will get referred to an Assistant Principal (for possible additional 
    consequences and/or Saturday detention) if any of the following apply:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>failure to show up for the detention period</li>
        <li>getting 5 or more absences in any quarter</li>
        <li>getting 10 or more absences in the year</li>
        <li>getting assigned to 3 Administrative Detentions in the year</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>Staff members are available in the 8th period activity office to help you any time during the day. Please stop by any 
    time if you have any questions or need help.</p>
