Intranet is a student-built project that was originally built to support the Eighth Period program at TJHSST, but now does so much more.  Prior to the 1999-2000 school year, several students laid the foundation for what became this web-based solution, partially as an assurance against potential 2-digit year problems with the aging Eighth Period system, but more importantly as a simplified and enriched way to register.  <p />

Intranet2 is a redeveloped version of Intranet made with many years of hindsight and updated to modern versions of functionality.  Where Intranet innovated by using new technologies and proved extremely useful to students and faculty alike, Intranet2 aims to follow.  <p />
