Parking applicants,<br /><br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the following online application no
later than [<$deadline>]. In addition to completing this online component, there is a paper application available from Mr. McCormick at the Security Office that <b>must be filled out and returned by the same date</b>. Failure to complete either the paper or online components of the application will disqualify you. Do not include payment with the application; payment is due in the fall when you pick up your parking permit. You must also plan to have your driver's license by September 1, 2006 and have no more than 12 eighth period skips to be eligible.
</p>
<p>
The application considers the following criteria in assigning spots:<br />
<ul>
<li>Mentorship participation (this guarantees you a spot but does not give you spot preference)</li>
<li>Grade level (seniors over juniors)</li>
<li>Joint applications (joint over non-joint)</li>
<li>Number of 8th period skips over the past year (considered in groups: fewer than 5; 6-10; 11-12)</li>
<li>First come first serve (earlier online submissions means higher priority)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can help your odds by completing both
applications on time, clearing incorrect skips with the 8th period office no
later than [<$deadline>], and applying jointly with another student. A joint application means that two students will share one spot and one parking permit. This allows the two students to collectively only ever have one car on campus on a given day. The advantage is that by sharing a spot, you are placed at the top of the priority list and thus have a greater chance of receiving your spot of choice.
