Parking applicants,<br /><br />
<p>
Complete the following online application no
later than [<$deadline>].
In addition to completing this online component, <b>there is a paper application available from Mr. McCormick at the Security Office that must be filled out and returned by the same date.
Students failing to apply online during the designated "online application period" will be allocated a parking space AFTER all other spaces have been assigned, if any are available.</b>
Do not include payment with the application; payment is due in the fall when you pick up your parking permit.
You must also plan to have your driver's license by September 1, 2006 and have no more than 11 eighth period unexcused absences to be eligible. <b> You must have no outstanding debts to TJHSST.</b>
</p>
<p>
Based on the number of student applications received, the following prioritized criteria will be used for allocating student parking spaces:<br />
<ol>
<li>Senior-Senior or Senior-Junior (Joint Application) -- Each student must have 0 to 3 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Seniors with less than 5 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Seniors with 6 to 10 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Seniors with no more than 11 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Junior-Junior (Joint Application)</li>
<li>Juniors with less than 5 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Juniors with 6 to 10 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Juniors with no more than 11 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
<li>Students failing to apply online during the designated "online application period" will be allocated a parking space AFTER all other spaces have been assigned, if any are available.</li>
<li>Parking spaces will be assigned <b>randomly</b> within the above listed priorities.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
You can help your odds by completing both
applications on time, <b>clearing incorrect unexcused absences with the 8th period office no
later than [<$deadline>]</b>, and applying jointly with another student. A joint application means that two students will share one spot and one parking permit. This allows the two students to collectively only ever have one car on campus on a given day. The advantage is that by sharing a spot, you are placed at the top of the priority list and thus have a greater chance of receiving your spot of choice.
Joint applications must be stapled together when turned in to the Safety &amp; Security Office.
