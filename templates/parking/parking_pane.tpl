Parking applicants,<br /><br />
<p>
	The TJHSST campus will be going through many changes as we get closer to the start of renovation.  Due to the changes during the summer/fall of 2012, only seniors will be allowed to park on campus.  At this time the number of spaces that will be available for student parking is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
	Complete the following online application no
	later than [<$deadline>].
	In addition to completing this online component, <b>there is a paper application available from the main office that must be filled out and returned to the security office by the same date.
	Students failing to apply online and by paper application during the designated &ldquo;application period&rdquo; will be allocated a parking space AFTER all other spaces have been assigned, if any are available.</b>
	<b>Do not include payment with the application; payment is due in the fall when you pick up your parking permit.</b>
	You must also plan to have your driver's license by September 5<sup>th</sup>, 2012 and have no more than 11 eighth period unexcused absences to be eligible. <strong>You must have no outstanding debts to TJHSST.</strong>
</p>
<p>To encourage ride sharing joint applicants are guarenteed student parking but recieve no priority status. <b> Joint applications will be allocated parking spaces based on the same priorities as all other applicants.</b></p>
<p>
	Based on the number of student applications received, the following prioritized criteria will be used for allocating student parking spaces:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mentorship students driving to work locations</li>
	<li>Seniors with no Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
	<li>Seniors with 1 to 5 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
	<!--<li>Seniors with no more than 6 to 11 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
	<li>Juniors with no Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
	<li>Juniors with 1 to 5 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>
	<li>Juniors with no more than 6 to 11 Eighth Period Unexcused Absences</li>-->
</ol>

<p>
	Any student with more than five eighth period unexcused absences will be ineligible for student parking.  Students failing to apply online during the designated &ldquo;online application period&rdquo; will be allocated a parking space AFTER all other spaces have been assigned, if any are available.
	<br />
	Parking spaces will be assigned <b>randomly</b> within the above listed priorities.
</p>

<strong>Juniors, on-campus parking unavailable at this time</strong>

<p>
You can help your odds by completing both
applications on time, <b>clearing incorrect unexcused absences with the 8th period office no
later than [<$deadline>]</b>. A joint application means that two students will share one spot and one parking permit. This allows the two students to collectively only ever have one car on campus on a given day.
Joint applications must be stapled together when turned in to the Safety &amp; Security Office.
