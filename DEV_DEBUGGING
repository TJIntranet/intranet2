1: Major errors being concealed
	- Failing to load a template or file
2: Minor errors being concealed
	- Incorrectly formatted queries
	- Attempting to set an invalid style
	- Having to use the default value of something in an INI file

If it would be level 1 or 2, carefully consider throwing an exception instead of trying to continue.
	
3: Strange events which are almost certainly abnormal
	- Queries returning errors
4: Strange events which are probably abnormal
	- Queries timing out
	- Weird combinations of session variables (user but no password, etc)

Levels 3 and 4 will usually be errors thrown and dropped to debugging in the error handler.

5: Strange events which are not necessarily abnormal
	- No 8th-period activities in the given future

Things 5 and above will probably always be logged to a file.
	
6: Less frequent, but normal, events
	- Construction of null objects
	- User not having CSL files but attempting to access them anyway
	- User's CSL auth failing with their LAN username and password
	
7: Routine module usage and high-volume stuff
	- LDAP queries
	- MySQL queries
	- Group-status messages ("user is an XYZ admin")
8: Server connections
	- LDAP and MySQL connections
	- Authentication babble
9: Module loading
	- "Loading Module XYZ"

P: Profiling debug commands
	- These are called to tell the amount of time a particular operation took server-side.
	- Mainly for optimization
	- enable with debug_profile = true in config.ini
